Welcome to iDOC= - the international CBM documentation project!

The goal of iDOC= is to preserve (non-English) Commodore related documents
in electronic text format that might otherwise cease to exist with the rapid
advancement of computer technology and declining interest in 8-bit computers
on the part of the general population. If you would like to help by
converting Commodore related hardcopy documents to electronic texts please
contact the manager of iDOC=, Peter Karlsson, at pk@abc.se.

Extensive efforts were made to preserve the contents of the original
document. However, certain portions, such as diagrams, program listings, and
indexes may have been either altered or sacrificed due to the limitations of
plain vanilla text. Diagrams may have been eliminated where ASCII-art was
not feasible. Program listings may be missing display codes where
substitutions were not possible. Tables of contents and indexes may have
been changed from page number references to section number references.
Please accept our apologies for these limitations, alterations, and possible
omissions.

Document names consists of a reasonably short unique title, followed by the
document language. Two optional fields follow; first the document version (0
for incomplete texts, version 1 is usually unnumbered), and then the
document source, if there are more than one. Finally, the document is given
a .txt extension.

The author(s) of the original document and members of iDOC= make no
representations about the accuracy or suitability of this material for any
purpose. This etext is provided "as-is". Please refer to the warranty of the
original document, if any, that may included in this etext. No other
warranties, express or implied, are made to you as to the etext or any
medium it may be on. Neither the author(s) nor the members of iDOC= will
assume liability for damages either from the direct or indirect use of this
etext or from the distribution of or modification to this etext. Therefore
if you read this document or use the information herein you do so at your

The iDOC= etext of the VIC-20 Programmer's Reference Guide, converted to
text by Asbjørn Djupdal <djupdal@stud.ntnu.no>

vic20prg_en.txt, March 1999, etext #47.

Note from the etexter: 

Version 1.1, 15 March 1999

Here you have the complete VIC 20 Programmer's Reference Guide. I wanted to
have this book as an etext, but couldn't find more than a few sections on
the Internet. That is why I typed it in myself. I have (of course) used the
sections that already were available, but I proofread them and changed the
layout to match the rest of the book. The 6502 instruction set description
was taken from the C64PrgRefGuide etext, because it with only a few
modifications were identical with the one in this book.

Sections not typed by me:
 - Working With Graphics p.82-94 (unknown)
 - Sound and Music p.95-106 (unknown)
 - 6502 instructions p.140-167 (from C64PrgRefGuide.txt, Ville Muikkula,
     vmuikku@yrttis.ratol.fi or vmuikku@raahenet.ratol.fi)
 - Memory map p.170-181 (Sam Laur, slaur@utu.fi, posted to comp.sys.cbm,
     2. March 1994)
 - 6522 Versatile Interface Adapter p.218-226 (unknown)

Centered and right-justified text assumes a line-width of 75. Some lines are
longer than that because I wanted to keep the lines the same as the
original book (not true everywhere). I have not bothered to make the pages
the same length.

Some special signs and comments:
   ~ means new page
   {sign} are placed where a non-ASCII sign should be present
   ^ are placed where an up-arrow should be present
   <- are placed where a left-arrow should be present
   {key} are placed where a picture of that special key should be present
   {sym} are placed where a VIC graphics character should be present
   {picture missing} are placed where there should be a picture

This text is hand-typed, so there are probably some errors in it. If you
find some, please report them to me so I can correct them. That includes
errors in the original book.

You should read this text using a non-proportional font.

                                                           REFERENCE GUIDE!

  The Friendly Computer deserves a Friendly Reference Book.
  That's why we wrote the VIC 20 PROGRAMMERS REFER-
ENCE GUIDE...a book that gives you more information about
your VIC 20 Personal Computer than any other source. This guide
was compiled from the experience of Commodore's international
Programming staffs in more than half a dozen countries, and is
designed to be used by first-time computerists as well as
experienced programmers.
  To cover the areas VIC 20 programmers are most interested in,
we divided the book into four sections: BASIC Programming,
Machine Language Programming, Input/Output Interfacing and
Programming Graphics & Sound.
  Here are just a few of the ways the VIC 20 Programmer's
Reference Guide helps meet your programming needs:
  --Our complete "dictionary" includes not only BASIC com-
mands but also sample programs to show you how they work.
  --Need an introduction to Machine Level Programming? Our
laymen's overview gets you started.
  --The exclusive KERNAL helps assure the programs you write
today won't be outdated tomorrow.
  --The VIC's Interface section lets you expand your computer...
from RS232 for telecommunications to joysticks, game paddles
and lightpens.
  --You'll have fun learning about the VIC's graphic, sound and
music capabilities...including the unique "multicolor" mode.
  --You'll discover POKE's you never knew about, and probably
PEEK into some memory locations you never knew existed.

                                     v

  There are lots of fascinating hours ahead of you. Let the
Programmer's Reference Guide be your companion as you
continue to explore your VIC 20 Personal Computer System.
  And...if you find any errors in this book, please send us a
postcard or letter in care of VIC PROGRAMMER'S REFERENCE
GUIDE, VIC Product Marketing Group, Commodore Business
Machines, Inc., 681 Moore Road, King of Prussia, PA 19406. We'd
appreciate your assistance in helping us "debug" our reference
guide for future printings.
  Enjoy your new reference guide...and happy programming!

VIC 20 APPLICATIONS GUIDE

  When you first consider buying a computer, the chances are
you said something like, "I know computers are good things to have
and it's nice they're finally affordable, but...what can I do with
one?"
  The great thing about a computer is that you can tailor the
machine to do what you want it to - you can make it calculate your
home budget, play arcade - style action games - you can even
make it talk! And the best thing is, if your VIC 20 does only ONE of
the things listed below, it's well worth the price you paid for it.
  Here then, is a list of applications for your VIC 20 - in case you've
asked yourself, "Yes, but what else can I do with it?"

APPLICATIONS               COMMENTS/REQUIRE -
                                 MENTS

GAMES                      Adams Adventure games on car-
                           tridge, decoded to "talk" with the
                           VOTRAX "Type N Talk"(tm).

ADVERTISING &              Hook the VIC to a television and put
MERCHANDISING              it in a store window with an animated

VIC BASIC: THE LANGUAGE OF
THE VIC

  The BASIC computing language is a powerful and easy-to-use
means of communicating instructions to your VIC 20 Personal
Computer. VIC BASIC is the same language used in the
Commodore PET/CBM line of microcomputers, and is nearly
identical to the BASIC used in most other personal computers.
Learning BASIC now can prepare you to move up to a more
sophisticated computer in the future, and can also give you the
foundation you need to learn other "higher level" computing
languages.
  If you're a first-time computerist, you'll be pleased to know you
can write your first BASIC program on the VIC within 15 minutes,
using the VIC 20 PERSONAL COMPUTER GUIDE which comes
with the machine. Additional self-teaching aids are available from
Commodore as part of the TEACH YOURSELF PROGRAMMING
SERIES, and classes offered by schools, computer centers and
retail stores can give you a solid grounding in the fundamentals of
BASIC within 4-6 hours.
  The VIC BASIC instructions which follow will provide a valuable
reference as you learn to write BASIC, or as you put into practice
the techniques you've already learned. Each entry in the listing
explains how the instruction is used, with practical examples.
Additional programming tips are included in a separate "BASIC
PROGRAMMING TIPS" section.
  BASIC has approximately 60 words in its vocabulary and is
surprisingly easy to learn. That doesn't mean you can't keep
improving, however. Like any language, BASIC has its own
"idioms" and complexities which you can use to write increasingly
sophisticated programs. VIC BASIC even has a sort of "slang" in
that you can abbreviate most of the commands by typing the first
letter of the instruction and the SHIFTED second letter. Using
abbreviated commands to write programs makes programming the
VIC fast and convenient. (Note that if you LIST a program written in
abbreviated form, the full-length commands are displayed to help
you read your program.)
  In BASIC, all instructions are commonly referred to as
"commands," although technically the BASIC instruction set can
be broken down into several areas...which is how we've grouped
them in the following VIC BASIC "vocabulary" guide. We've
included separate sections on several types of BASIC instructions:
Commands, Statements, Input/Output Statements, Functions,
Numbers and Variables, and Operators.

                                     3
~
  It should also be noted here that while we communicate with the
VIC through the BASIC language, the VIC's "native" vocabulary is
Machine Language which is based on a binary or hexadecimal
numbering system. BASIC is really a translation of Machine
Language into terms we humans can understand...which is why
BASIC programs generally run slower than Machine Language
programs run immediately. See "Introduction to Machine Lan-
guage Programming" for more information.
  Of course, you don't have to know BASIC to take advantage of
the VIC's computing power...you don't even have to know how to
type. We like to say that with the VIC 20, the first thing you do is
learn "computing"...not "programming." You don't have to be an
auto mechanic to drive a car, and by the same token you don't have
to be a programmer to "drive" your VIC 20. Still, knowing something
about how your car works mechanically helps you maintain and use
your car to best advantage. Likewise, knowing how the computer is
programmed helps you get the most out of your VIC 20.
  In the future, being able to "speak" a computer language will give
you a tremendous advantage over those who can't...not because
you can write a computer program, but because you'll have a better
understanding of what a computer is and does, and you'll be able to
make better use of computing at school, on the job and at home.
Learning BASIC...or at least how it works...will bring you close
to the future and prepare you for the dramatic technological
changes that are already occurring as part of the "Computer
Revolution."

WARM START - If you get into trouble or want to break out
of a program while it's running, you can hold down the
RUN/STOP key and hit the RESTORE key. This combination
resets the VIC without losing your program. Now you can
LIST or RUN your program again.

COMMANDS

  Basic commands tell the VIC to do something with a program.
For example, you "command" the VIC to list, run, stop, continue,
save and load programs.
  BASIC commands may be used in direct mode (without line
numbers) or as instructions in BASIC programs. In direct mode,
commands are executed as soon as the RETURN key is pressed.
  In a BASIC program, commands are included like any other
instruction, and executed when you type RUN. The only command
which may not be used in a program is CONT.
  VIC BASIC commands include the following:

  CONT
  LIST
  LOAD
  NEW
  RUN
  SAVE
  VERIFY

CONT

Format:                 Abbreviation:                 Screen Display:
-------                 -------------                 ---------------
CONT                      C{shift}O                       C{sym}

  This command is used to re-start the execution of a program
which has been stopped by either using the STOP key, a STOP
statement, or an END statement within the program. The program
will re-start at the exact place from which it left off. While the
program is stopped, the user can inspect or change any variables
or look at the program. CONT will not work if you have changed or
added lines of the program (or even just moved the cursor to a
program line and hit RETURN without changing anything), or if the
program halted due to an error, or if you caused an error before
typing to re-start the program. The message in this case is CAN'T
CONTINUE ERROR.
  This is a handy tool when debugging a program. It lets you place
STOP statements at strategic locations in the program, and
examine variable values when the program stops. You can keep
using STOP and CONT until you find what you're looking for.

                                     5
~
EXAMPLE:

10 PI = 0: C = 1
20 PI = PI + 4/C + 4/(C + 2)
30 PRINT PI
40 C = C + 4:GOTO 20

  This program calculates the value of PI. RUN this program, and
after a short while hit the {run/stop} key. You will see the display:
BREAK IN 20
  Type the command PRINT C to see how far the VIC has gotten.
Then use CONT to resume from where the VIC left off.

LIST

Format:*                Abbreviation:                 Screen Display:
-------                 -------------                 ---------------
LIST [from line number]   L{shift}I                       L{sym}
     - [to line number]

  The LIST command allows you to look at lines of the BASIC
program currently in the VIC's memory. The VIC's powerful screen
editor allows you to easily and quickly edit programs which you
have LISTed.
  The LIST command can specify which program line number will
be shown. If you type LIST and a single line number, only that line
will be displayed. If the number is followed by a hyphen (-), all the
lines from that number forward will be shown. If the number is
preceded by the hyphen, all lines from the beginning to that line will
be shown. You can LIST a range of line numbers by typing the two
line numbers separated by a hyphen, in which case the lines from
the first number to the second number are shown. If LIST 0 is typed,
the whole program will be LISTed and not just line 0.

  If the program length exceeds the length of the screen display,
the first lines in the program will scroll off the screen during LISTing.
To slow down the scrolling ,hold down the {ctrl} key. To stop
the program during a LIST, hit the {run/stop} key.

  The LIST command may also be used as a statement within a
BASIC program, but the program will stop as soon as the LIST is
finished.

*All format entries should be typed in one line.

                                     6

EXAMPLES OF LIST COMMAND
LIST              LISTs whole program
LIST 0            LISTs whole program
LIST 100          Line 100 only
LIST 100-         Everything from 100 on
LIST -100         Shows from start to 100
LIST 100-150      Starts at 100 and stops with 150

EXAMPLE OF LIST STATEMENT
(Program Mode)
10 PRINT"THIS IS LINE 10"
20 LIST
30 PRINT"THIS IS LINE 30"

LOAD

Format:                 Abbreviation:                 Screen Display:
-------                 -------------                 ---------------
LOAD ["filename",         L{shift}O                       L{sym}
      device, command]

  The LOAD command transfers a program from cassette tape or
disk into the VIC's memory, where it can be used or changed.

LOAD FROM TAPE

  If the program to be LOADed is the first one on the tape, all you
have to type is the word LOAD by itself. Unless the PLAY key was
already down, the VIC answers with the message:
PRESS PLAY ON TAPE.
  Once the recorder has been started, the VIC says:
OK
SEARCHING
FOUND
LOADING
  At this point, any program that had been in memory is lost,
because the new one has begun to take its place. (If you use the
{run/stop} key to halt the LOAD, there will likely be a spot in the
program with garbage, just at the point where you stopped it.)
  Once the program has finished the LOAD, the VIC says:
READY.

                                     7
~
  When the program is not the first on the tape, or you're not sure
that it is, the VIC can search for the program you want. Type LOAD
and the name of the program inside quote marks("), or the name of
a string variable containing the name of the program. The VIC will
show any other programs or files that it sees on the tape with the
message:
FOUND name
  The VIC will only LOAD the correct program, and will not LOAD a
data file on that tape.

LOAD FROM DISK
  In order to bring in a program from a device other that the tape, a
device number is used. Following the name of the program, type a
comma(,) and the number (or variable containing the number). The
cassette is device number 1. The disk drive is device-number 8. See
the manual of the device for its number.
  If the program with that name is not found on the device, a FILE
NOT FOUND ERROR will result. This doesn't happen on tape,
since the VIC has no way of sensing that there are no more
programs on a tape. It is possible to put an end-of-tape marker on
the tape, using the SAVE or OPEN statements, and if the VIC reads
this marker while searching a tape, an error message appears.
  The VIC will automatically LOAD the program into the beginning
of BASIC program memory, at location 4096 in a machine without
an extra 3K of memory, or at 1024 with the extra 3K. For certain
applications this may not be convenient. By following the device
number with a comma and the command number 1, the VIC will be
sure to LOAD the program in the same spot in memory from which it
was SAVEd.
  LOAD can be used as a statement in a BASIC program. The
program will be RUN as soon as LOADing is finished. Variables
used in the first program will not be cleared as long as the new
program is shorter in length than the older one. If a longer program
is LOADed on a short one, the BASIC program lines will over-write
the variables, and changing a variable will mess up the program.
  Note that using an asterisk can save loading time (see
examples).

EXAMPLES:
LOAD              Reads in the next program from tape
LOAD "HELLO"      Searches tape until the program called
                  HELLO is found, than it is LOADed.
LOAD A$           Uses the name in A$ to search.

                                     8
~
LOAD "*",8        LOADs first program from disk.
LOAD "AB*",8      Loads first program beginning with AB.
LOAD "HELLO",8    Looks for a program on device 8 (disk
                  drive).
LOAD "",1,1       Looks for the first program on tape, and
                  LOADs it into the same part of memory that
                  it came from.
10 LOAD"NEXT",8   Finds the program called NEXT on device
                  8, LOADs, then RUNs it.

  Because of possible problems with old tapes or misaligned
recorders, it is possible that the program will not LOAD correctly.
The VIC stores two copies of the program on the tape. If they don't
match, the message LOAD ERROR is displayed. The program may
LIST correctly, but probable won't. In any case, there is most likely
some problem, some section of memory that is not right, and the
program should be re-LOADed. It is wise to make an extra copy of
any program, in case you run into this problem at some time.
  In the case of a very bad LOAD, some of the important memory
locations inside the VIC may be changed. If you get weird results
after a LOAD, like the VIC not understanding normal BASIC
commands anymore, you'll have to turn the VIC off and than on
again.

NEW

Format:                 Abbreviation:                 Screen Display:
-------                 -------------                 ---------------
NEW                         None                           None

  NEW is used to tell the VIC to erase a current program from
memory so a different program can be used. Unless the program is
stored (on tape or disk), it will be lost unless it is typed in again from
the beginning. For this reason, you should BE CAREFUL when
using this command! Not clearing out an old program before typing
in a new one can result in a confusing mixing of the two program.
  NEW can also be used as a statement within a program. When
this instruction is executed, the program in memory is erased, and
the program stops. This is not good programming technique,
especially if you RUN the program and it erases itself while you're
writing or debugging it.

EXAMPLE:
NEW      Clears the program & variables.
10 NEW   Performs the NEW operation and stops the program.

RUN [line number]        R{shift}U                        R{sym}

  This command causes a BASIC program to begin operating. The
command RUN by itself start the program at the lowest numbered
line. All values are cleared when this commands is given.
  RUN followed by a number causes the program to start working
from another line than the lowest numbered one. If that line number
does not exists, the message UNDEF'D STATEMENT ERROR
appears. RUN followed by a variable will first clear the value of that
variable, and try to start the program at line 0, if it exists.

EXAMPLES:
RUN      Starts at the beginning
RUN 100  Starts at line 100
RUN X    Start at line 0, or UNDEF'D
         STATEMENT ERROR if no line 0

SAVE ["filename",         S{shift}A                       S{sym}
      device, command]

  The SAVE command stores a program currently in memory on
tape or disk. The program being SAVEd is not affected and remains
in the VIC's memory after the save operation. Programs on tape are
stored twice automatically, so the VIC can check for errors when
LOADing the program back in.
  The command SAVE all by itself sends the program to the
cassette deck without a name. When the command is given, the
VIC will say:
PRESS RECORD AND PLAY ON TAPE
  Holding down the RECORD button, press PLAY, and the VIC will
say:
OK
SAVING

                                    10
~
and begin storing. The VIC cannot check the RECORD key; it can
only sense that the tape is moving, so be sure to press RECORD. If
PLAY was already pressed, no message appears.
  When the program has been SAVEs, the VIC will give the
message:
READY.
  The VIC has no way of searching for a blank spot on the tape, but
just records wherever it is, erasing any information that may have
been there. However, the VERIFY command can be used to find
the end of the last program.
  SAVE can be followed by a program name in quotes or in a string
variable. The VIC will then write the program name before the
program on the tape, which lets the VIC find it more easily.
  The program can be SAVEd on a device other than the tape deck
by giving a device number. To do this, put a comma after the
program name, and then the number of the device. The cassette
deck is device number 1, and the disk is number 8. (See examples.)
  It is possible to instruct the VIC to SAVE a program so it will not be
moved in memory when LOADed. Using command number 1 after
the device number will do this. This is useful when working with
different memory configurations which may cause VIC memory
locations to shift.
  To prevent a user from accidentally trying to read past the last
information on the tape, the VIC can also write an end-of-tape
marker after the program. To do this, follow the device number with
a comma and command number 2. When the VIC finds this marker,
it will stop and show the message DEVICE NOT PRESENT
ERROR.
  Commands number 3 is a combination of 1 and 2, telling the
program on tape not to relocate and to put an end-of-tape marker
after the program.
  SAVE can also be used as a statement within a BASIC program.
When this statement is hit, the program will be SAVEd normally,
with the usual prompts appearing on the screen. The program
resumes normally after the SAVE.

EXAMPLES
SAVE                 Stores program on tape without name
SAVE "HELLO"         Stores on tape with name HELLO
SAVE A$              Stores on tape with name in A$
SAVE "HELLO",8       Stores on device number 8 (disk drive)
SAVE "HELLO",1,1     Won't relocate HELLO upon re-LOADing

                                    11
~
SAVE "HELLO",1,2     Puts an end-of-tape marker after the
                     program.
SAVE "HELLO",1,3     Won't relocate & end-of-tape marker
10 SAVE"HELLO"       Saves the program, then goes on with the
                     next program line.

VERIFY

Format:                 Abbreviation:                 Screen Display:
-------                 -------------                 ---------------
VERIFY "filename",        V{shift}E                       V{sym}
       device

  This command checks the program on tape or disk against the
program in the VIC's memory. VERIFY is normally used right after a
SAVE, to make sure the program was stored correctly on the tape
or disk. VERIFYing a program after it has been LOADed is useless,
since the same incorrect program could be in both places.
  When you tell the VIC to VERIFY, this message shows:
PRESS PLAY ON TAPE
  Once the tape is moving, the VIC checks the program against
memory, reading until the end of the program. If the copies match,
the VIC says:
OK
READY.
  If there is a problem, you will see this message:
?VERIFY ERROR
  In this case, you should immediately SAVE the program on a
different tape or disk and try again.
  The format of the VERIFY command is similar to the LOAD
command. A program name can be given either in quotes or a string
variable, and the VIC will search for that program. If a comma and a
device number follow the name, the VIC will look at the device
designated.
  VERIFY is also used to position a tape just past the last program
so a new program can be added to the tape without over-writing an
older one. Just VERIFY with the name of the last program there; the
VIC searches, checks the program, and stops with a VERIFY
ERROR. However, your program is still in memory, and now the
tape is at a blank spot. You can SAVE without worry.

                                    12
~
EXAMPLES:
VERIFY               Checks the first program on tape.
VERIFY "HELLO"       Searches for HELLO, then checks
VERIFY "HELLO",8     Looks on device 8 for the program.

  This statement clear out any variables that have been defined,
un-DIMensions any arrays, and RESTOREs the DATA pointer

  The DATA statement holds information that will fill variables in a
READ statement. Any type of information can be stored here,
separated by commas. If a comma, space, or color are to be used
as data, they must be enclosed in quote marks("). Two commas
with nothing in between will be read as zero, or an empty string.
Note: the information in brackets is optional.
  The line containing the DATA statement doesn't actually have to
be executed while RUNning the program, so most programmers
leave all the DATA statements at the end of the program, out of the

~
  When a long mathematical formula is used several times in
different lines of a program, program memory and typing time can
be saved by using a defined function for the formula. The function is
then used throughout the program in place of the lengthy formula.
  Here's an example of a simple formula definition, with an
example of its use in the program.

EXAMPLE 1:
10 DEF FNA(X) = 7 * X
20 PRINT FNA(1)
30 PRINT FNA(3)

  The result of line 20 is 7, and the result in line 30 is 21.

EXAMPLE 2:
10 DEF FNA(X) = INT(RND(1)*6) + 1
20 PRINT FNA(10)

  When the function in this example is used in the program, the
value of the number in parentheses in line 20 doesn't have any
effect on the result. This is because in line 10 the variable (X) in the
parentheses doesn't appear in the formula on the right.
  The next example does use the variable name in the formula.

EXAMPLE 3:
10 DEF FNA(X) = INT(RND(1)*X) + 1
20 PRINT FNA(10)

  In this case, the number in the parentheses in line 20 does affect
the result. The number in the parentheses in line 20 is the largest
random number that will be picked.
  The result of a defined formula must always be a number; there
are no defined functions for string variables.

DIM

    (number,...,number),
    [variable (number,...,number),...]

  This statement defines an array or matrix of variables, which
allows you to use the variable name with a subscript. The subscript
points to the element in the array being used. The lowest element
number in an array is zero, and the highest is the number given in
the DIM statement. If an array variable is used without a DIM
statement to create it, it is automatically DIMensioned to 10 in each
dimension.
  Let's suppose we wanted to keep track of the score of a football
game. There are 2 teams, and four quarters plus a possible
overtime quarter in the game. We could use a matrix to hold the
scores in each quarter. Here is a program that asks you for the
score of each team in each quarter:

EXAMPLE:
100 DIM S(1,5), T$(1)
110 INPUT "TEAM NAMES";T$(0),T$(1)
120 FOR Q = 1 TO 5
130 FOR T = 0 TO 1
140 PRINT T$(T),"SCORE IN QUARTER" Q
150 INPUT S(T,Q)
160 S(T,Q) = S(T,0) + S(T,Q)
170 NEXT T,Q
180 PRINT CHR$(147) "SCOREBOARD"
190 PRINT "QUARTER";
200 FOR Q = 1 TO 5
210 PRINT TAB(Q*2 + 9)Q;
220 NEXT
230 PRINT TAB(15)"TOTAL"
240 FOR T = 0 TO 1
250 PRINT T$(T)
260 FOR Q = 1 TO 5
270 PRINT TAB(Q*2 + 9) S(T,Q);
280 NEXT
290 PRINT TAB(15) S(T,0)
300 NEXT

                                    17
~
  The element numbers in every dimension start at 0 and end at the
number in the DIM statement. The number of elements created in
any dimension is the maximum subscript number PLUS 1. The total
number of elements is equal to the product of the number of
elements in all dimension multiplied together.
  There may be any number of dimensions and any number of
elements in an array, limited only by the amount of RAM memory
that is available to hold the variables. The array may be made up of
normal numeric variables, as shown above, or of strings or integer
number. If the variables are to be other than normal numeric,
simply use the $ or % signs after the variable name to indicate string
or integer variables.
  It's easy to calculate the amount of memory that will be used up
by an array:
MEMORY USED = 5 bytes for variable name
              2 bytes for each dimension
              2 bytes/element for integer variables
              5 bytes/element for normal numeric variables
              3 bytes/element for string variables
              1 byte byte for each character in each string
              element

END                       E{shift}N                       E{sym}

  This statement will finish the program when RUNning and return
complete control of the VIC to the person operating it. The CONT
command can be used to resume execution of the program after
the END statement was reached, because no variables or pointers
are cleared.
  The END statement results in the message: READY.
  The difference between STOP and END statements is slight: the
STOP statement displays the message:
BREAK IN LINE XXX
  Neither STOP nor END is required to appear at any point in the
program in VIC BASIC, because a program running out of lines to
execute will END all by itself.

FOR variable =            F{shift}O                       F{sym}
    start TO limit [STEP increment]

  This is a special BASIC statement that lets you easily use a
variable as a counter. You must specify certain parameters: the
variable name, its starting value, the limit of the count, and how
much to add during each cycle.
  Here is a simple BASIC program that counts from 1 to 10,
PRINTing each number and ENDing when complete, and using no
FOR statements:
100 L = 1
110 PRINT L
120 L = L + 1
130 IF L<=10 THEN 110
140 END

  Using the FOR statement, here is the same program:
100 FOR L = 1 TO 10
110 PRINT L
120 NEXT L
130 END

  As you can see, the program is shorter and easier to understand
using the FOR statement. Here is a closer look at the parameters,
to see how everything works.
  The variable can be any numeric variable name except an array
variable. When the program reaches a FOR statement, variable is
set to the value of start. The program proceeds with the statements,
until a statement containing the word NEXT is reached.
  At that point, increment is added to variable's value. The STEP is
optional, and if there is no STEP shown increment is assumed to be
+1.
  After increment has been added to variable, the value of variable
is compared to limit. If the limit has not been exceeded the program
continues with the line after the FOR statement. If the limit has been
passed, the line to be executed is the line following the NEXT
statement. Note: if the STEP value is positive, variable will exceed
limit when its value is greater than limit, and if the STEP value is
negative, the variable must be less than limit to end the
count. The loop will always be executed at least once, re-
gardless of the values in "start" and "limit".

GET variable              G{shift}I                       G{sym}

  This statement lets you input one character at a time from the
keyboard. Whatever character was hit goes into the variable. If no
key was pressed, a zero is placed in a numeric variable, or an
empty value ("") in a string variable. This differs from the INPUT
statement in one major respect: If no key is typed, the program
continues running here, and in the INPUT statement it waits for the
user to type something.
  The GET statement is usually placed in a loop to wait rot the
keystroke.

EXAMPLE 1:
10 GET A$:IF A$ = "" THEN 10

  The GET can also be used to allow the program to continue
processing while waiting for data. Example 2 is a simple GET editor
with a blinking cursor.

EXAMPLE 2:
10 C = 0:Q = 18
20 GET A$:C = C + 1
30 IF C = 10 THEN Q = 164 - Q:C = 0

~
  This is a specialized form of the GOTO statement, with the
important difference that GOSUB remembers where it came from.
When the RETURN statement (different from the RETURN key on
the keyboard) is reached in the program, the program jumps back
to the statement immediately following the original GOSUB
statement from which it came.
  The major use of a subroutine (GOSUB really means GO to a
SUBroutine) is when there is a small section of program that is used
by different sections of the program. By using subroutines rather
than repeating the same lines over and over at different places in
the program, you can save lots of program space. In this way,
GOSUB is similar in use to DEF FN: DEF FN lets you save space
when using a formula, and GOSUB saves space when using a
several-line routine.
  Here is an inefficient program that doesn't use GOSUB:
100 PRINT "THIS PROGRAM PRINTS"
110 FOR L = 1 TO 500:NEXT
120 PRINT "SLOWLY ON THE SCREEN"
130 FOR l = 1 TO 500:NEXT
140 PRINT "USING A SIMPLE LOOP"
150 FOR L = 1 TO 500:NEXT
160 PRINT "AS A TIME DELAY."
170 FOR L = 1 TO 500:NEXT

  Here is the same program using GOSUB:
100 PRINT "THIS PROGRAM PRINTS"
110 GOSUB 200
120 PRINT "SLOWLY ON THE SCREEN"
130 GOSUB 200
140 PRINT "USING A SIMPLE LOOP"
150 GOSUB 200
160 PRINT "AS A TIME DELAY."
170 GOSUB 200
180 END
200 FOR L = 1 TO 500:NEXT
210 RETURN

  Each time the program executes a GOSUB, the line number and
position in the program line are saved in a special area called the
"stack", which takes up 256 bytes of your memory. This limits the
amount of data that can be stored in the stack. Therefore, the
number of subroutine return addresses that can be stored is limited,
and care should be taken to make sure every GOSUB hits the
corresponding RETURN, or else you'll run out of memory even
though you have plenty of bytes free.

GOTO or GO TO

GOTO line number          G{shift}O                       G{sym}

  This simple statement allows the BASIC program to execute
lines out of numerical order. The word GOTO followed by a number
will make the program jump to the line with that number. GOTO
cannot be followed by a variable, but must have the line number
typed after the word GOTO.

EXAMPLE 1:
10 GOTO 10

  Notice that the loop in the example never ends, since the
program keeps running the same line over and over. This is called
an "infinite loop," and can be utilized when you want a program to
stop in place and wait. The only way to stop an infinite loop is with
the {run/stop} key.

EXAMPLE 2:
10 PRINT "HELLO";
20 GOTO 10

IF...THEN

Format:                     Abbreviation:             Screen Display:

IF expression THEN line number  None                       None
IF expression THEN statement

  This is the statement that gives BASIC most of its "intelligence,"
the ability to evaluate conditions and take different actions
depending on the outcome.
  The word IF is followed by an expression, which can include
variables, strings, numbers, comparisons, and logical operators.
The word THEN is followed on the same line by either a line number
or one or more BASIC statements. When the expression is false,
everything after the word THEN on that line is ignored, and

                                    22
~
execution continues with the next line number in the program. A
true result makes the program either branch to the line number after
the word THEN or execute whatever other BASIC statements are
found on that line.

EXAMPLE 1:
100 INPUT "TYPE A NUMBER";n
110 IF N <= 0 THEN 200
120 PRINT "SQUARE ROOT="SQR(N)
130 GOTO 100
200 PRINT "NUMBER MUST BE > 0"
210 GOTO 100

  This program prints out the square root of any positive number.
The IF statement here is used to validate the result of the INPUT.
When the result of N <= 0 is true, the program skips to line 200,
and when the result is false the next line to be executed is 120. Note
that GOTO is not needed with IF..THEN, as in line 110 where
THEN 200 actually means THEN GOTO 200.

EXAMPLE 2:
100 FOR L = 1 TO 100
110 IF RND(1) < .5 THEN X = X + 1:GOTO130
120 Y = Y + 1
130 NEXT L
140 PRINT "HEADS=" X
150 PRINT "TAILS=" Y

  The IF in line 120 tests a random number to see if it is less than .5.
When the result is true, the whole series of statements following the
word THEN is executed: first X is incremented by 1, then the
program skips to line 130. When the result is false, the program
drops to the next statement, line 120.

EXAMPLE 3:

  This program will fill the entire screen with Z's, including the
bottom right corner, and then freeze. The IF in line 120 checks for
both X = 23 and Y = 22 being true, or else the program just drops
through to line 130. When the conditions are true, the VIC PRINTs a
cursor left and an insert.
  By the way, this really is a trick to PRINT in the lover right corner
in the screen without forcing the screen to scroll up a line. This is
because you never really PRINT in that position, you insert in the
position before that, which pushes the character into position.
  For those of you using cartridges that add extra commands to
BASIC, like "Super Expander" and "Programmers Aid", make sure
that you put a colon between the word THEN and one of the extra
commands.

INPUT

Format:                 Abbreviation:                 Screen Display:
-------                 -------------                 ---------------
INPUT ["prompt";]           None                           None
       variable

  This is a statement that lets the person running the program
"feed" information into the computer. When executed, this
statement PRINTs a question mark (?) on the screen, and positions
the cursor 2 spaces to the right of the question mark. Now the
computer waits, cursor blinking, for the operator to type in the
answer and press the RETURN key.
  The word INPUT may be followed by any text contained in quote
marks ("). This text is PRINTed on the screen, followed by the
question mark.
  After the text comes the name of one or more variables
separated by commas. This variable is where the computer stores
the information that the operator types. The variable can be any
legal variable name, and you can have several different variable
names, each for a different input.

EXAMPLE 1:
100 INPUT A
110 INPUT B,C,D
120 INPUT "PROMPT";E

                                    24
~
  When this program runs, the question mark appears to prompt
the operator that the VIC is expecting an input for line 100. Any
number typed in goes into A, for later use in the program. If the
answer typed was not a number, the ?REDO FROM START
message appears, which means that a string was received when a
number was expected. If the operator just hit RETURN without
typing anything, the variable's value doesn't change.
  Now the next question mark, for line 110, appears. If we type only
one number and hit RETURN, the VIC will now display 2 question
marks (??), which means that more input is required. You can just
type as many inputs as you need separated by commas, which
prevents the double question mark from appearing. If you type
more data than the INPUT statement requested, the ?EXTRA
IGNORED message appears, which means that the extra items
you typed were not put into any variables.
  Line 120 displays the word PROMPT before the question mark
appears. The semicolon is required between the prompt and any
list of variables. Note: The only way to end a program during
an INPUT statement is to hold down the RUN/STOP key and
hit RESTORE.

LET

[LET] variable =          L{shift}E                       L{sym}
      expression

  The LET statement is used to set a variable to a value. The value
can be a constant (like 5) another variable (like C), or a complex
formula (like PI*PI + 3). The LET statement also works with string
variables.
  Since the LET statement is used so often in BASIC programs, the
word 'LET' has been made optional, since it did nothing but take up
memory. Advanced programmers always leave it out.

LET B=1                 This is the same as B = 1
A = 3*3+33-B            A will equal 41
A$ = "CAT" + "DOG"      A$ will equal "CATDOG"

NEXT [variable,variable   N{shift}E                       N{sym}
      ,...,variable]

  This statement completes a loop that was started by a FOR
statement. If the word NEXT is not followed by a variable name, the
loop completed is the last one that was started. If there is a variable
name given, that loop is finished. If the loop being finished wasn't
the last one started, any loops between the last one and the one
specified in NEXT statement are lost.
  Care must be taken when placing loops within other loops, to
complete them properly. Here is an example of correct placement
("nesting") of loops.

EXAMPLE 1:
10 FOR L = 1 TO 100
20 FOR M = 1 TO 10
30 NEXT M
40 NEXT L

  Notice that the first loop finished is the last one that was started.
Here are some general examples of the NEXT statement.

-------                 -------------                 ---------------
ON variable GOTO number [,number,...,number]
ON variable GOSUB number [,number,...,number]

  This statement allows the program to choose from a list of line
numbers to go to. If the variable has a value of 1, the first line
number is the one chosen. If the value is 2, the second number in
the list is used, and so on. If the value in the variable is less than 1 or
greater than the number of line numbers in the list, the program just

                                    26

ignores the statement and continues with the statement following
the ON statement.

EXAMPLE 1:
ON X GOTO 100,130,180,220
ON X+3 GOSUB 9000,20,9000

  ON is really an under-used variant of the IF...THEN...
statement, which can send the program to one of many possible
lines. Using formulas and logical operators, one ON statement can
replace a whole list of IF statements.

EXAMPLE 2: IF statements
IF A=7 THEN 400
IF A=3 THEN 900
IF A<3 THEN 1000
IF A>7 THEN 100

POKE location,value       P{shift}O                       P{sym}

  This statement allows you to alter the value of any RAM location
in memory. There are a possible 65,536 locations in the VIC's
memory, and in an unexpanded VIC a little more than 5K of them
are RAM and can be changed. Your 5K of RAM is in locations
numbered from 0 to 1023 and from 4096 to 8191. The memory
maps in Chapter 3 describes the contents of the first 1K. Your BASIC
program, variables, and the screen memory all go in the 4K area.

                                    27
~
Color RAM is an extra half-K block of memory starting at 38400.
There are also alterable areas in some of the chips, like the VIC chip
from 36864 to 36879 and the 6522 chips above that.
  Because each memory location holds 1 byte, which can have a
value from 0 to 255, only number in that range can be POKEd into
memory.

EXAMPLE:
POKE 36879,8
POKE A,B

PRINT             Abbreviation: ?
                  -------------
  There is no statement in BASIC with more variety than the PRINT
statement. There are so many symbols, functions, and parameters
associated with this statement that it might almost be considered as
a language of its own within BASIC, a language specially designed
for writing on the screen.

Quote mode
  Once the quote mark (SHIFT 2) is typed, the cursor controls stop
operating and start displaying reversed characters which actually
stand for the cursor control you are hitting. This allows you to
program these cursor controls, because once the text inside the
quotes is PRINTed they perform their functions. The DEL key is the
only cursor control not affected by "quote mode."

1. Cursor movement
  The cursor controls which can be "programmed" in quote mode
are:

   Key               Appears as

   {crsr up}         {sym}
   {crsr down}       {sym}
   {crsr left}       {sym}
   {crsr right}      {sym}
   {clr}             {sym}
   {home}            {sym}
   {inst}            {sym}

                                    28
~
  If you wanted the word HELLO to PRINT diagonally from the
upper left corner of the screen, you would type:
PRINT "{home}H{crsr down}E{crsr down}L{crsr down}L{crsr down}O"
or
PRINT "{sym}H{sym}E{sym}L{sym}L{sym}O"

2. Reverse characters
  Holding down the {ctrl} key and hitting {rvs on} will cause a {sym}
to appear inside the quotes. This will make all characters start
printing in reverse video (like a negative of a picture). To end the
reverse printing, hit {ctrl}{rvs off}, which prints a {sym} or else
PRINT a {return}. (Just ending the PRINT statement without a
semicolon or comma will take care of this.)

3. Color controls
  Holding down the CTRL key with any of the 8 color keys will make
a special reversed character appear in the quotes. When the
character is PRINTed, then the color change will occur.

   Color          Appears as

   {blk}          {sym}
   {wht}          {sym}
   {red}          {sym}
   {cyn}          {sym}
   {pur}          {sym}
   {grn}          {sym}
   {blu}          {sym}
   {yel}          {sym}

  If you wanted to PRINT the word HELLO in cyan and the word
THERE in green, type:
PRINT "{ctrl}{cyn}HELLO{ctrl}{grn}THERE"
or
PRINT "{sym}HELLO{sym}THERE"

                                    29
~
4. Insert mode
  The spaces created by using the insert (inst) key have some of
the same characteristics as quote mode. The cursor controls and
color controls show up as reversed characters. The only difference
is in the {del} and {inst}{del}, which performs its normal function
even in quote mode, now creates the {sym}. And {inst}, which created
a special character in quote mode, insert spaces normally.
  Because of this, it is possible to create a PRINT statement
containing DELetes, which cannot be PRINTed in quote mode.
Here is an example of how this is done:
10 PRINT "HELLO"{del}{inst}{inst}{del}{del}P"
which displays as
10 PRINT "HELLO{sym}{sym}P"

  When the above line is RUN, the word displayed will be HELP,
because the last two letters are deleted and the P is put in their
place.
  WARNING: The DELetes will work when LISTing as well as
PRINTing, so editing a line with these characters will be difficult.
  The "insert mode" condition is ended when the RETURN (or
SHIFT RETURN) key is hit, or when as many characters have been
typed as spaces were inserted.

5. Other special characters
  There are some other characters that can be PRINTed for
special functions, although they are not easily available from the
keyboard. In order to get these into quotes, you must leave empty
spaces for them in the line, hit RETURN or SHIFT RETURN, and go
back to the spaces with the cursor controls. Now you must hit CTRL
RVS ON, to start typing reversed characters, and type the keys
shown below:

   Function                      Type
   --------                      ----
   SHIFT RETURN                  SHIFT M
   switch to lower case          N
   switch to upper case          SHIFT N
   disable case-switching keys   H
   enable case-switching keys    I

  The SHIFT RETURN will work in the LISTing as well as
PRINTing, so editing will be almost impossible if this character is
used. The LISTing will also look very strange.

READ

READ variable list        R{shift}E                       R{sym}

  This works with the DATA statement to fill variables with values
stored within the program. The information is usually in the form of a
list that is READ in at the beginning of the program, or a table that is
re-READ during the program. READ works just like INPUT, except
that the information comes from DATA statements instead of the
person working the program.

EXAMPLE:
10 READ A,B,C$
20 DATA 1,2,HELLO THERE!

REM

Format:                 Abbreviation:                 Screen Display:

REM any text                None                           None

  This statement makes your program more easily understood
when LISTed. It is a reminder to yourself to tell you what you had in
mind when writing each section. For instance, you might tell what a
variable is used for, what date the program was written, or some
other useful piece of information. The REMark can be any text,
word, or character, including the colon (:) or BASIC keywords.
Therefore, the REM statement is the last one on a line that the
program sees.
  If you try to use graphic characters in a REM statement without
using a quote mark (") first, when you LIST the line you'll see BASIC
keywords instead of the graphic characters. This is because the
VIC thinks these characters are the "tokens" for those commands.
The BASIC tokens are discussed in the last part of this chapter.

EXAMPLE.
REM PROGRAM BY SUE M. 10/6/81          Good example
REM A$ HOLDS 22 CURSOR DOWNS           Good example
LET A=1:REM PUT A 1 IN A               Bad example

RESTORE                  RE{shift}S                      RE{sym}

  This statement sets the DATA statement pointer back to the first
DATA statement in the program. Each time you READ the DATA,
the pointer advances through all the items in the first DATA
statement, then through the items in the next DATA statement, and
so on through all the DATA statements in the program. In order to
re-READ the items, use the RESTORE statement.

EXAMPLE:
10 DATA 1,2,3,4
20 DATA 5,6,7,8
30 FOR L = 1 TO 8
40 READ A:PRINT A

RETURN                   RE{shift}T                      RE{sym}

  This statement completes a subroutine that was begun with the
GOSUB statement. When the GOSUB is performed, the VIC
remembers which line it came from. When it later hits a RETURN
statement, it goes back to the statement right after the original
GOSUB. This is similar to a GOTO, except the GOSUB subroutine
can be performed and the program continued from the original
GOSUB line.

EXAMPLE:
  10 PRINT "THIS IS THE PROGRAM"
  20 GOSUB 1000
  30 PRINT "PROGRAM CONTINUES"
  40 GOSUB 1000
  50 PRINT "MORE PROGRAM"
  60 END

STOP                      S{shift}T                       S{sym}

  This statement will halt a program and return control to the user.
The only difference between the STOP and END statement is that
the message BREAK IN LINE XXXX appears when the STOP is used,
just as if the user had pressed the {run/stop} key.

EXAMPLE:
100 STOP

SYS

SYS location              S{shift}Y                       S{sym}

  This is the most common way to mix a BASIC program with a
machine language program. The machine language program
begins at the location given in the SYS statement. When the
machine language instruction RTS (return from subroutine) is
reached, the program jumps back to the BASIC program, right after
the SYS statement. A machine language program can be POKEd
into memory from BASIC or created with the aid of VICMON(tm).

EXAMPLE:
SYS 64802               resets the VIC from power-up
POKE 4400,96:SYS 4400   returns immediately

WAIT location,            W{shift}A                       W{sym}
     mask1[,mask2]

  For most programmers, this statement should never be used. It
causes the program to halt until a specific memory location's bits
change in a specified way. This is used for arcane I/O operations
and almost nothing else.
  The WAIT statement takes the value in the memory location and
performs a logical AND operation with the value in mask1. If there is
a mask2 in the statement, the result of the first operation is
exclusive-ORed with mask2. This sounds confusing, but there's an
easier way to look at it. The mask1 value "filters out" any bits that
we don't want to test. Where the bit is 0 in mask1, the corresponding
bit in the result will always be 0. The mask2 value will flip any bits, so
we can test for an off condition as well as on. Any bits being tested
for a 0 should have a 1 in the corresponding position in mask2.

EXAMPLE:
WAIT 36868,144,16

  What are we testing for here? Here's a binary look at our two
masks:
144 = 10010000
16 = 00010000
  This WAIT statement will halt the program until either the 128 bit
is on or the 32 bit is off.

CLOSE file#              CL{shift}O                      CL{sym}

  This closes the file that was started in an OPEN statement. It is
recommended that a PRINT# to that file be performed before
closing the file, to make sure that all data has been transmitted. Not
closing an OPEN file results in a FILE OPEN ERROR.

EXAMPLE:
OPEN 1,4:PRINT#1,"HI THERE!":CLOSE1

CMD

Format:                 Abbreviation:                 Screen Display:

CMD file#                 C{shift}M                       C{sym}

  This changes the normal output device of the VIC from the
screen to the file specified. In this way, data and LISTings can be
sent to other devices, like the printer, disk, or tape drive. When
finished transmitting, to reset output to the screen, do a PRINT#
and CLOSE the file.

EXAMPLE:
OPEN 1,4:CMD1:PRINT "HELLO THERE!":PRINT#1:CLOSE1

GET# file#,                 None                           None
     variable

  This statement receives data one byte at a time from any
OPENed device. If no data is available, it works the same as the
GET statement, returning a null value. The INPUT# statement can
get more than one character, and will get all the characters up to a
carriage return (CHR$(13)). The GET# will receive any characters,
1 at a time, including special characters like the carriage return and
quote marks.

EXAMPLE:
10 OPEN 1,3
20 PRINT CHR$(147)"HELLO THERE"CHR$(19);
30 FOR L = 1 TO 22
40 GET#1,B$:A$ = A$ + B$
50 NEXT:PRINT A$:CLOSE 1

  If you examine A$ when this program is finished, you'll see that
the last character is a CHR$(13), a carriage return, which
terminates the line.

INPUT#

Format:                 Abbreviation:                 Screen Display:
-------                 -------------                 ---------------
INPUT# file#,             I{shift}N                       I{sym}
       variable1[,variable2,etc.]

  This usually is the fastest and easiest way to retrieve data that
was stored in a file on tape or disk. The data is in the form of whole
variables, as opposed to the one-byte-at-a-time method of GET#.
First the file must have been OPENed, then you can use INPUT# to
fill your variables.

EXAMPLE:
10 OPEN1,1,0,"TAPE FILE NAME"
20 PRINT "FILE IS OPEN OK"
30 INPUT#1,A$,B$
40 CLOSE 1

                                    36
~
  When using the screen (device #3) as an input device, the
INPUT# statement can be used to read any whole line of text
from the screen. The last character of the line will be read as
a CHR$(13), as if the screen hit the RETURN key at the end
of the line!
  However, there are times when it's not always practical to use
INPUT#, and some precautions are in order. If a string variable put
on the file has certain characters, using INPUT# could have
unexpected results. If you use CHR$(13), or a comma (,) or
semicolon (;) or colon (:), the VIC will think that this marks the end of
your variable. If you put quote marks (CHR$(34)) at the start and
end of your string when it is written, it will come back intact.
  INPUT# may also be used to "INPUT" data without the question
mark (?) prompt being displayed. This is very useful for a variety of
applications, for example if you want to set up a graphic chart and
let the operator INPUT data to the chart without question marks
being displayed.

EXAMPLE:
10 OPEN1,0
20 PRINT "ENTER A NUMBER";INPUT#1,A
30 PRINT A "TIMES" 5 "EQUALS" A*5

OPEN file#,              O{shift}P                       O{sym}
     [device#,command#,string]

  This statement OPENs a channel for input and/or output to a
device. This device can be part of the VIC, like the screen and
keyboard, or an accessory, like the tape recorder, printer, or disk
drive. When OPENing a channel to an external device, the VIC sets
up a buffer for the data, and only transmits and receives whole
buffers at a time.
  The file# can be any number from 1 to 255, and is the same
number that will be used in the INPUT#, GET#, and PRINT#
statements to work with this device. The device# specifies which
device, and is set within that device.

  The string at the end is sent to the printer or screen as if a
PRINT# were performed to that device. With the cassette deck, it is
used for the filename, and with disk it can be a filename or some
control information.

EXAMPLE:
OPEN 1,0                Read the keyboard
OPEN 1,1,0,"name"       Read from cassette

PRINT# file#,             P{shift}R                       P{sym}
       variable list

  This sends the contents of the variables in the list to the device
that was previously OPENed. They will be transmitted in the same
format as if PRINTed to the screen; if commas are used as
separators extra spaces will appear, if semicolons are used no
space will appear, and a CHR$(13) is the last character sent if there
isn't a comma or semicolon at the end of the line. The easiest way to
write more than one variable to a file on tape or disk is to set a string
variable to CHR$(13), and use that string in between all the other
variables when writing the file.

EXAMPLE:
100 OPEN 1,1,1,"TAPE FILE"
110 R$ = CHR$(13)
120 PRINT#1,1;R$;2;R$;3;R$;4;R$;5
130 PRINT#1,6
140 PRINT#1,7

  This example shows how to write a tape file that can be easily
read back using INPUT# statements, since each variable has a
CHR$(13) printed after it. You can also print "," or ";" to separate
the variables.

VIC 20 BASIC FUNCTIONS

  The intrinsic functions provided by BASIC are presented in the
following paragraphs. The functions may be called from any
program without further definition.
  Arguments to functions are always enclosed in parentheses. In
the formats given for the functions in this chapter, the arguments
have been abbreviated as follows:
  X and Y      Represent any numeric expression
  I and J      Represent integer expressions
  X$ and Y$    Represent string expressions

  If a floating point value is supplied where an integer is required,
BASIC will round the fractional portion and use the resulting
integer.

NUMBERS AND VARIABLES

  The numbers printed by VIC20 are governed by limitations within
their formats. The numbers are stored internally to over ten digits of
accuracy. However, when a number is printed, only nine digits are
displayed. Each number may also have an exponent (a
power-of-ten scaling factor).
  Numbers are used all the time when working with VIC20. There
are two kinds of numbers that can be stored: floating point numbers
(also called real numbers) and integers.
  Floating point is the standard number representation used by the
VIC. The VIC does its arithmetic using floating point numbers. A
floating point number can be a whole number, a fractional number
preceded by a decimal point, of a combination. The number can be
signed negative (-) or positive (+). If the number has no sign, it is
assumed to be positive.
  Consider the following examples of floating point numbers:

  Whole number equivalent to an integer:
  5
  -15
  65000
  161
  0
  Numbers with a decimal point:
    0.5
    0.0165432
   -0.00009
    1.6
   24.0085
  -65.6
    3.1416

  Notice that if you put a comma in a number and ask the VIC to
assign it to a variable, you will get a Syntax Error message. For
example, you must use 65000, not 65,000.
  Numbers always have at least eight digits of precision; they can
have up to nine, depending on the number. The VIC rounds any
additional significant digits. It rounds up when the next digit is five or
more; it rounds down when the next digit is four or less.
  Rounding numbers will sometimes cause fractional numbers to
look inaccurate. Here are some examples:

                                    54
~
You type:         ?.5555555556
VIC prints:        .555555555
(VIC appears to round down on 6 or less; up on 7 or more.)

You type:         ?.5555555557
VIC prints:        .555555556

You type:         ?.1111111115
VIC prints:        .111111111
(VIC appears to round down on 5 or less; up on 6 or more).

You type:         ?.1111111116
VIC prints:        .111111112

  These quirks result from the manner in which computers store
floating point numbers.
  Floating point numbers can also be represented in scientific
notation. When numbers with ten or more digits are entered, the
VIC automatically converts them to scientific notation. Scientific
notation allows the VIC to accurately display these large numbers
using fewer digits. For example:

  READY.
  ?1111111114
  1.11111111E+09

  READY.
  ?1111111115
  1.11111112E+09

A number in scientific notation has the form:
                         numberE{+/-}ee
Where:
  number    is an integer, fraction, or combination, as illustrated
            above. The "number" portion contains the number's
            significant digits; it is called the "coefficient." If no
            decimal point appears, it is assumed to be to the
            right of the coefficient.
  E         is the upper case letter E
  {+/-}     is an optional plus sign or minus sign which indicates
            the sign of the exponent
  ee        is a one- or two-digit exponent. The exponent
            specifies the magnitude of the number; that is, the
            number of places to the right (positive exponent) or
            to the left (negative exponent) that the decimal point
            must be moved to give the true decimal point
            location.

                                    55
~
Here are some examples:

Scientific Notation              Standard Notation
    2E1                              20
    10.5E+4                          105000
    66E+2                            6600
    66E-2                            0.66
    -66E-2                           -0.66
    1E-10                            0.0000000001
    94E20                            9400000000000000000000

  As the last two examples show, scientific notation is a much more
convenient way of expressing very large or very small numbers.
VIC BASIC prints numbers ranging between 0.01 and 999,999,999
using standard notation; however, numbers outside of this range
are printed using scientific notation.
  Consider the following out-of-range examples:

  ?.009
   9E-03

  READY.
  ?.01
   .01

  READY.
  ?999999998.9
   999999999

  READY.
  ?999999999.6
   1E+09

  There is a limit to the magnitude of a number that the VIC can
handle, even in scientific notation. The range limits are:

  Largest floating point number: {+/-}1.70141183E+38
  Smallest floating point number: {+/-}2.93873588E-39

  Any number of larger magnitude will give an overflow error. For
example:
  ?1.70141184E+38

  ?OVERFLOW ERROR
  READY.

  Any number of a smaller magnitude will yield a zero result. For
example:
  ?2.93873587E-39
   0

                                    56
~
  READY.

  An integer is a number that has no fractional portion or decimal
point. The number can be signed negative (-) or positive (+). An
unsigned number is assumed to be positive. Integer numbers have
a limited range of values, from -32768 to -32767.
  The following are examples of integers:
  0
  1
  44
  32699
  -15
  Any number that is an integer can also be represented in floating
point format since integers are a subset of floating point numbers.
VIC BASIC converts any integers to floating point representation
before doing arithmetic with them. The most important difference
between floating point numbers and integers is that an integer array
uses less storage space in memory (two bytes for an integer,
versus five bytes for a floating point number).
  We have already used strings as messages to be printed on the
display screen. A string consists of one or more characters
enclosed in double quotation marks.
  Consider the following examples of strings:

  "HI"
  "SYNERGY"
  "12345"
  "$10.89 IS THE AMOUNT"

  All of the data keys (alphabetic, numeric, special symbols, and
graphics), the three cursor control keys (Clear Screen/Home,
Cursor Up/Down, Cursor Left/Right), as well as the Reverse On/Off
key, Insert/Delete, and Stop keys can be included in a string. The
only keys that cannot be used within a string are Return, CTRL,
Shift, and the Logo key.
  All characters within the string are displayed as they appear. The
cursor control and Reverse On/Off keys, however, normally do not
print anything themselves; to show that they are present in a string,
certain reverse field symbols are used. They are shown in Table
2-1.
  When you enter a string from the keyboard, it can have any
length up to the space available within an 88-character line (that is,
any character spaces not taken up by the line number and other
required parts of the statement). However, strings of up to 255
characters can be stored in the VIC's memory. You get long strings

                                    57
~
by pushing together, or concatenating, two separate strings to form
one longer string. We will describe this further when we discuss
string variables in general.
  Earlier in this chapter, we introduced the concept of a variable. In
this discussion variables are described more thoroughly.
  A variable is a data item whose value may be changed. The value
is determined by the number assigned to the variable. If you type
the immediate mode statement:

  PRINT 10,20,30
  10     20     30

  The VIC will display the same three numbers (as illustrated
above) whenever the PRINT statement is executed; that is
because this PRINT statement used constant data. However, you
can write the immediate mode statement:

  A=10:B=20:C=30:PRINT A,B,C
  10     20     30

  The same three number, 10,20,30, are displayed; however, A,
B, and C are variables, not constants. By changing the values
assigned to A,B, and C, you can change the valued printed out by
the PRINT statement. Consider the following example of this:

  A=-4:B=45:C=4E2:PRINT A,B,C
  -4     45     400

You will notice that variables appear in virtually all computer
programs.
  Variables are identified by names. We used A, B, and C as
variable names in the illustration above. A variable has two parts:
its name and a value. The variable name represents a location at
which the current value is stored. In the following illustration, the
current value of A is 14; for B it is 15; and for C it is 0.

      Variable
        Name               Contents
         A                    14
         B                    15
         C                    0

If we change A to -1 using the immediate mode statement:
  A=-1
then the Location Contents, stored under the variable-name A, will
change from 14 to -1.
  This is an excellent way of looking at variables because it is, in

                                    58
~
fact, the way they are handled by the VIC. A variable name
represents an address in memory; and at that memory location, the
current value of the variable is stored. The important point to note is
that variable names - which are names that programmers make
up - are arbitrary; they have no innate relationship to the value that
the variables represent.
  A variable name can have one or two characters. The first
character must be an alphabetic character from A to Z; the second
character can be either alphabetic or numeric (numeric characters
must be in the range from 0 to 9). A third character can be included
to indicate the type of number (integer or string), % or $.
  Floating variables represent floating point numbers. This is
probably the most common type of variable that you will use.

  The following are examples of floating point variables:

  A
  B
  A1
  AA
  Z5

  Integer variables represent integers. Names for integer variables
are followed by the % symbol as the following examples indicate:

  A%
  B%
  A1%
  MN%
  X4%

  Remember, floating point variables can also represent integers;
but you should use integer variables in arrays whenever possible
since they use less memory - two bytes versus five for a floating
point array element.
  A string variable represents a string of text. The following are
examples of string variables:

  A$
  M$
  MN$
  M1$
  ZX$
  F6$

  You can use variable names having more than two alphanumeric
characters; but if you do, only the first two characters count. To VIC

                                    59
~
BASIC, therefore, BANANA and BANDAGE are the same name
since both begin with BA.
  The advantage of using longer variable names is that they make
programs easier to read. PARTNO, for example, is more
meaningful that PA as a variable name describing a part number in
an inventory program.
  VIC BASIC allows variable names to have up to 255 characters.
The following are examples of names with more than the minimum
number of characters:

  MEMBER$
  T1234567
  BBB$
  ABCDPG%
  PARTY

  If you use extended variable names, keep in mind the following:

  1. Only the first two characters, plus the identifier symbol, are
     significant in identifying a variable. Do not use extended
     names like LOOP1 and LOOP2; these refer to the same
     variable: LO.
  2. VIC BASIC has what are called "reserved words." These are
     words that have special meaning for the VIC BASIC
     interpreter. No variable can contain a reserved word. In longer
     names you have to be very careful that a reserved word does
     not occur embedded anywhere in the name.
  3. The additional characters need extra memory space, which
     you might need for longer programs.

  The BASIC interpreter recognizes certain words as requests for
specific operations. Names that are used to call up certain
operations are called "reserved words." These words cannot be
used as variable names because the interpreter will recognize the
word as a request for the corresponding operation. Moreover, you
cannot use a reserved word as any part of your variable name;
BASIC will still find it and treat it as a request for an operation.

ARRAYS

  An array is a sequence of related variables. A table of numbers,
for example, may be visualized as an array. The individual numbers
within the table become "elements" of the array.
  Arrays are a useful shorthand means of describing a large
number of related variables. Consider, for example, a table of
numbers containing ten rows of numbers, with twenty numbers in

                                    60
~
each row. There are 200 numbers in the table. How would you like it
if you have to assign a unique name to each of the 200 numbers? It
would be far simpler to give an entire table one name, and identify
individual numbers within the table by their table location. That is
precisely what an array does for you.
  Arrays of up to eleven elements (subscripts 0 to 10 for a
one-dimensional array) may be used where needed in VIC BASIC,
just as variables can be used as needed. Arrays containing more
than eleven elements need to be "declared" in a Dimension
statement. Dimension statements are described later in this and in
Chapter 3. An array (always with subscripts) and a single variable
of the same name are treated as separate items by VIC BASIC.
Once dimensioned, an array cannot be referenced with different
dimensions.

                                    61
~
OPERATORS

  An operator is a special symbol that VIC BASIC recognizes as
representing an operation to be performed on the variables or
constant data. One or more operators, combined with one or more
terms, form an "expression".
  VIC BASIC provides arithmetic operators, relational operators,
and Boolean operators.
  An arithmetic operator defines an arithmetic operation to be
performed on the adjoining terms. Arithmetic operations are
performed using floating point numbers. Integers are converted to
floating point numbers before an arithmetic operation is performed;
the result is converted back to an integer. Consider the following
operations and their symbols:

  a. Addition (+). The plus sign specifies that the term on the left
is to be added to the term on the right. For numeric quantities this is
straightforward addition. Examples:

  2 + 2
  A + B + C
  X% + 1
  BR + 10E-2

  The plus sign can be used to add strings; but rather than adding
their values, they are joined together, or concatenated, forming one
longer string. The difference between numeric addition and string
concatenation can be visualized as follows:

  Addition numbers:
    num1 + num2 = num3

  Addition of strings:
    string1 + string2 = string1string2

  By concatenation, strings containing up to 255 characters can be
developed.

EXAMPLES:
"FOR"+"WARD"      results in "FORWARD"
"HI"+"THERE"      results in "HITHERE"
A$+B$             results in A$B$

  b. Subtraction (-). The minus sign specifies that the term to the
right of the minus sign is to be subtracted from the term to the left.

EXAMPLES:
4 - 1          results in 3
100 - 64       results in 36
A - B          results in the difference between
               the value of the two variables.
55 - 142       results in -87

  The minus sign can also be used as a unary minus; that is, the minus
sign preceding a negative number.

EXAMPLES:
-5
-9E4
-B
4--2 same as 4+2

  c. Multiplication (*). An asterisk specifies that the term on the
right is multiplied by the term on the left.

EXAMPLES:
100 * 2        results in 200
50 * 0         results in 0
A * X1
R% * 14

  d. Division (/). The slash specifies that the term on the left is to be
divided by the term on the right.

EXAMPLES:
10 / 2         results in 5
6400 / 4       results in 1600
A / B
4E2 / XR

  e. Exponentiation (^). The up arrow specifies that the term on
the left is raised to the power specified by the term on the right. If the
term on the right is 2, the number on the left is squared; if the term
on the right is 3, the number on the left is cubed, etc. The exponent
can be any number, variable, or expression, as long as the
exponentiation yields a number in the VIC's range.

                                    63

EXAMPLE:
2 ^ 2          results in 4
12 ^ 2         results in 144
1 ^ 3          results in 1

  When an expression has multiple operations, as in:
A+C*10/2^2
  There is a built-in hierarchy for evaluating the expressions. First,
the exponentiation is considered, followed by the unary minus (-),
followed by the multiplication and division (*/), followed then by the
addition and subtraction (+-). Operators of the same hierarchy
are evaluated from left to right.
  This natural order of operation can be overridden by the use of
parentheses. Any operation within parentheses is performed first.

EXAMPLES:
4 + 1 * 2         results in 6
(4 + 1) * 2       results in 10
100 * 4/2 - 1     results in 199
100 * (4/2 - 1)   results in 100
100 * (4/(2 - 1)) results in 400

  When parentheses are present, VIC BASIC evaluates the
innermost set first, then the next innermost, etc. Parentheses can
be nested to any level and may be used freely to clarify the order of
operations being performed in an expression.
  A relational operator specifies a "true" or "false" relationship
between adjacent terms. The specified comparison is made, and
then the relational expression is replaced by a value of true (-1) or
false (0). Relational operators are evaluated after all arithmetic
operations have been performed.

EXAMPLES:
1 = 5-4     results in true (-1)
14 > 66     results in false (0)
15 >= 15    results in true (-1)

  Relational operators can be used to compare string. For
comparison purposes, the letters of the alphabet have the order
A<B, B<C, C<D, etc. Strings are compared by comparing their
stored character values. Characters are stored using a special

                                    64
~
binary code called "ASCII." The Appendix lists the ASCII codes
assigned to every VIC character.

EXAMPLES:
"A" < "B"      results in true (-1)
"X" = "XX"     results in false (0)
C$ = A$ + B$

  The boolean operators AND, OR, and NOT specify a Boolean
logic operation to be performed on two variables, on adjacent sides
of the operator. In the case of NOT, only the term to the right is
considered. Boolean operations are not performed until all
arithmetic and relational operations have been completed.

EXAMPLES:
IF A=100 AND B=100 THEN 10
  If both A and B are equal to 100, branch to
  statement 10.
IF X<Y AND B>=44 THEN F=0
  If X is less than Y, and B is greater than
  or equal to 44, then set F equal to 0.
IF A=100 or B=100 THEN 20
  If either A or B has a value of 100, branch to
  statement 20.
IF X<Y OR B>=44 THEN F=0
  F is set to 0 if X is less than Y, or B is greater
  than 43.

  A single term being tested for "true" or "false" can be specified by
the term itself, with an implied "<>0" following it. Any non-zero
value is considered true; a zero value is considered false.

EXAMPLES:
IF A THEN B=2
IF A<>0 THEN B=2
  The above two statements are equivalent.
IF NOT B THEN B=2
  Brach if B is false, i.e., equal to zero. This is
probably better written as:
IF B=0 THEN 100

                                    65
~
  The three Boolean operators can also be used to perform logic
operations on the individual binary digits of two adjacent terms (or
just the term to the right in the case of NOT). But the terms must be
in the integer range. Boolean operations are defined by groups of
statements, which taken together constitute a "truth table." The
following table lists the truth tables for the Boolean operators used
by VIC BASIC.

                      Boolean Truth Table
 +-----------------------------------------------------------+
 | The AND operation results in a 1 only if both bits are 1. |
 |                       1 AND 1 = 1                         |
 |                       0 AND 1 = 0                         |
 |                       1 AND 0 = 0                         |
 |                       0 AND 0 = 0                         |
 |                                                           |
 |  The OR operation results in a 1 if either bit is 1.      |
 |                       1 OR 1 = 1                          |
 |                       0 OR 1 = 1                          |
 |                       1 OR 0 = 1                          |
 |                       0 OR 0 = 0                          |
 |                                                           |
 | The NOT operation logically complements each bit.         |
 |                       NOT 1 = 0                           |
 |                       NOT 0 = 1                           |
 +-----------------------------------------------------------+

  This discussion of binary digit (bit) oriented Boolean operations is
presented for those who are interested in the details of how these
operations are performed. If you do not understand it, skip it. You
are not skipping anything you must know. Recall that a single term
has an implied "<>0" following it. The expression therefore
becomes:

IF 0<>0 GOTO 40

Thus, the branch is not taken.
  In contrast, a Boolean operation performed on two variables may
yield any integer number:

IF A% AND B% GOTO 40

Assume that A%=255 and B%=240. The Boolean operation 255
AND 240 yields 240. The statement, therefor, is equivalent to:

                                    66
~
IF 240 GOTO 40

or, with the "<>0":

IF 240 <>0 GOTO 40

Therefore the branch will be taken.
  Now compare the two assignment statements*

A = A AND 10
A = A < 10

  In the first example, the current value of A is logically ANDed with
10 and the result becomes the new value of A. A must be in the
integer range +32767 to -32768. In the second example, the
relational expression A < 10 is evaluated to -1 or 0, so A must end
up with a value of -1 or 0.

                                    67
~
LOGICAL OPERATORS

  Logical operators perform tests on multiple relations, bit
manipulation, or Boolean operations. The logical operator returns a
bitwise result which is either "true" (not zero) or "false" (zero). In an
expression, logical operations are performed after arithmetic and
relational operations. The outcome of a logical operation is
determined as shown in the following table. The operators are listed
in order of precedence.

NOT

X     NOT X
1     0
0     1

AND

   X     Y   X AND Y
   1     1     1
   1     0     0
   0     1     0
   0     0     0

OR

   X     Y   X OR Y
   1     1     1
   1     0     1
   0     1     1
   0     0     0

  Just as the relational operators can be used to make decisions
regarding program flow, logical operators can connect two or more
relations and return a true or false value to be used in a decision.
For example:

IF D<200 AND F<4 THEN 80
IF I>10 OR K<0 THEN 50
IF NOT P THEN 100

                                    68
~
  Logical operators work by converting their operands to
sixteen-bit, signed, two's-complement integers in the range
-32768 to +32767. (If the operands are not in this range, an error
results.) If both operands are supplied as 0 or -1, logical operators
return 0 or -1. The given operation is performed on these integers
in bitwise fashion, i.e., each bit of the result is determined by the
corresponding bits in the two operands.
  Thus, it is possible to use logical operators to test bytes for a
particular bit pattern. For example, the AND operator may be used
to "mask" all but one of the bits of a status byte at a machine I/O
port. The OR operator may be used to "merge" two bytes to create
a particular binary value. The following examples will demonstrate
how the logical operators work:

63 AND 16 = 16    63 = binary 111111 and 16 = binary
                  10000, so 63 AND 16 = 16

15 AND 14 = 14    15 = binary 1111 and 14 = binary
                  1110, so 15 AND 14 = 14 (binary 1110)

 -1 AND 8 = 8     -1 = binary 11111111 and 8 =
                  binary 1000, so -1 AND 8 = 8

   4 OR 2 = 6     4 = binary 100 and 2 = binary 10, so 4
                  or 2 = 6 (binary 110)

 10 OR 10 = 10    10 = binary 1010, so 1010 OR 1010 =
                  1010 (10)

 -1 OR -2 = -1    -1 = binary 11111111 and -2 = binary
                  11111110, so
                  -1 OR -2 = -1. The bit complement of
                  sixteen zeros is sixteen ones, which
                  is the two's complement representation
                  of -1.

NOT X=(-X)+1      The two's complement of any integer is
                  the bit complement plus one.

STRING OPERATIONS

  Strings may be concatenated using +. For example:

10 A$ = "FILE":B$ = "NAME"
20 PRINT A$ + B$
30 PRINT "NEW" + A$ + B$
RUN
FILENAME
NEW FILENAME

                                    69
~
Strings may be compared using the same relational operators that
are used with numbers:

= <> < > <= >=

  String comparisons are made by taking one character at a time
from each string and comparing the ASCII codes. If all the ASCII
codes are the same, the strings are equal. If the ASCII codes differ,
the lower code number precedes the higher. If, during string
comparison, the end of one string is reached, the shorter string is
said to be smaller. Leading and trailing blanks are significant.
Examples:

"AA" < "AB"
"FILENAME" = "FILENAME"
"X$" > "X#"
"CL " > "CL"
"kg" < "KG"
"SMYTH" < "SMYTHE"
B$ < "9/12/78" where B$ = "8/12/78"

EDITING PROGRAMS

CURSOR CONTROLS

  One of the most important features of the VIC is the ability to
move the cursor around the screen and make changes to program
lines. This is called "screen editing." The VIC will allow cursor
movement around the screen in any direction, inserting extra
spaces into a line, and erasing unwanted characters. The VIC's
editor is one of the most powerful and easy to use of any computer.
  There are 6 keys on the keyboard that are used for editing. These
are the {clr/home}, {inst/del}, {crsr up/down}, {crsr left/right}, {return}, and the {space}
bar. These are all dual purpose keys, with different actions
when the {shift} or {c=} keys are pressed. The {crsr up/down},
{crsr left/right}, {inst/del}, and {space} will all repeat if held down for at
least a second.

a. {clr/home}
  When unshifted, this moves the cursor to the upper left corner of
the screen, called the "home position."
  With the {shift} (or {c=} key) held down, this key will
erase everything on the screen and move the cursor to the home
position. This does not erase a program, variables, or anything else
currently in memory.

b. {inst/del}
  Without the {shift}, this key serves to delete the character to
the left of the cursor. Anything else on the line to the right of the de-
leted character is moved one space to the left, filling in the gap.
  With the {shift}, this becomes an insert key. A space is cre-
ated at the cursor's position, and everything else on the line to the
right of the cursor is moved one more space to the right. If this
pushes the last character on the line past the right end of the line, all
lines below the current one are pushed down one line. Once the
line is filled all the way to the end of 4 screen lines (88 characters),
this key has no effect. (See also QUOTE MODE.)

                                    73
~
c. {crsr up/down}
  This will move the cursor up or down one line on the screen,
without affecting anything displayed on the screen. Unshifted, the
cursor moves down, and if you hold down the {shift} (or the
{c=} key) the cursor moves up.

e. {crsr left/right}
  This causes the cursor to move one space sideways. Unshifted,
the move is to the right; and shifted, the cursor moves left. All
characters remain on the screen without being erased. Notice that if
the cursor moves beyond the right edge of the screen, it "wraps"
one line down, to the left edge. If you move to the left edge the
cursor wraps to the right side of the next line up (except from the
home position).

e. {return}
  The primary purpose of this key is to "enter" an instruction,
calculation, or line of instructions. In direct mode the VIC executes
the instruction or calculation. In program mode (when the
instruction is preceded by a line number) the RETURN key causes
the program line to be stored in memory. However, when you hold
down the SHIFT key and hit RETURN, the VIC moves the cursor to
the next line and the left edge of the screen, but does not affect the
line or instruction - SHIFT RETURN is a fast method for moving the
cursor down the screen.

f. {space}
  When you hit the {space} bar (at the bottom of the keyboard) a
blank space appears on the screen and the cursor moves one
space to the right, erasing any character that was previously on that
position.
  If the {shift} or {c=} keys are held down while typing the
{space} bar, a character is printed that looks like a space but is
actually treated by the VIC as a graphic character.

EDITING LINES
  Anything displayed on the screen can be edited using the cursor
controls. This can be a program line that is LISTed or typed in, or a
command without a line number. To edit a line simply move the

                                    74
~
cursor until it is on the line, then make the required changes,
inserting or deleting as needed. Once you are finished, just hit the
{return} key. All the changes will be stored as made. If you just
want to get the cursor past the line it is on, just hold {shift} while
hitting {return} and the VIC will ignore the lines it passes.
  In order to delete a line from a program, just type the line number
and hit {return}. There is no command for deleting more that 1
line at a time, although there is a trick for erasing all but a few lines.
This involves LISTing the good portion of the program on the
screen, typing NEW, moving the cursor to the top line displayed,
and hitting {return} on all the lines. This method only works if the
section to be kept is very small (less than one screenful).

a. Direct Mode/"Calculator" Mode
  If you enter a command or set of commands without a line
number, they will execute as soon as you press the {return} key.
This is called "Direct Mode" or "Immediate Mode."
  Since the VIC allows multiple statements on a line by using the
colon (:), you can actually get a short program to run without
entering line numbers. This is especially helpful when there is
already a program in memory that you don't want to disturb. The
maximum length of a program line is 4 screen lines, or 88
characters. In other words, if you enter a line numbered 10 you can
display four 22-character lines on the screen but the VIC will store
and interpret the information as one 88-character program line.
  Here is a sample immediate mode program for a sound effect:
  (don't hit (return) until you've typed the whole line)
POKE 36878,15:FOR L=254 TO 128 STEP-1:POKE 36876,
L:POKE 36876,0:NEXT:POKE 36878,0
  Some people also call this "calculator mode," because one of the
most common things you can do with a VIC is perform calculations
that don't require a program.

  Here are some examples of calculations:
  PRINT 5+4
  PRINT (2+4)*5/9
  PRINT SIN(37)

  Certain commands can't be used in direct mode. These are:
INPUT, INPUT#, GET, GET#, and DEF FN. The DATA statement

                                    75
~
may be typed but has absolutely no effect. The first four commands
shown can't be used because the same buffer that holds the
statement being executed is also used to hold the characters being
input. The DEF FN statement requires a line number so that the
formula may be referenced later.

b. Program Mode
  Instructions beyond a basic level of complexity require a
program, as opposed to direct mode commands which can perform
simple commands in a single line of instructions. A program is one
or more lines, each having its own unique number and containing
a statement or group of statements. Line numbers must be whole
numbers from 0 to 63999. Programs are usually written using every
10th number, or even 100th number, since most programmers
want to add more lines later between two existing lines, as the
program is developed or edited.
  Line numbers are stored in numerical order regardless or the
order in which they are typed. The program will, when RUN,
execute from the lowest to highest numbered lines, unless there is
a command to jump to a different line, like GOTO, IF...THEN, or
GOSUB.

                                    76
~
USING THE GET STATEMENT

  Most simple programs use the INPUT statement to get data from
the person operating the computer. When dealing with more
complex needs, such as protection from typing errors, the GET
statement offers more flexibility and gives the program more
intelligence. This section shows you how to use the GET statement
to add some special screen editing features to your programs.
  The VIC has a keyboard buffer that holds up to 10 characters.
This means if the computer is busy doing some operation and is not
reading the keyboard, you can still type in up to 10 characters, and
the VIC will use them as soon as it finishes what it was doing.
  This can be demonstrated with a simple program. Type in the
program shown below. When you tell it to RUN, type the word
HELLO on the keyboard. Since the VIC is busy in a loop, nothing
appears on the screen - until the program stops after 15 seconds,
and the word HELLO that you typed appears on the screen.

  10 TI$ = "000000"
  20 IF TI$ < "000015" THEN 20

  The VIC's input buffer is also called a queue, which is a good
image to use to better understand how it works. Imagine standing in
line waiting to buy a ticket to get into a movie. The first person in line
is the first to get a ticket and leave the line, and the last person in line
is the last to get a ticket. (In accounting, this is called the "first in, first
out" method, or FIFO, as opposed to the "last in, first out", or LIFO
method.)
  The GET statement in the VIC acts as the ticket taker. First it
looks to see if there are any characters "in line" (if a key or keys
have been typed). If there are, the first character typed gets placed
in a "variable" and out of the queue. If no characters are waiting in
the buffer an empty value is returned.
  One other point should be mentioned when talking about the
queue. Any characters typed on the VIC's keyboards after the queue
is full are lost, since the queue was full. So imagine that the ticket
line is long enough to hold 10 people, and there is a cliff at the end of
the line. Anyone trying to get into the line after the line is full simple
falls off the cliff, never to be seen again.
  Since the GET statement will keep going even when no character
was typed, it is often necessary to put the GET statement into a
loop, having it wait until the operator hits a key (actually, until a
character has been received). Here is the recommended form:

(Type NEW to erase the previous program.)
  10 GET A$ : IF A$ = "" THEN 10

                                    77
~
  There must be NO SPACE between the quotes in this line, to
indicate an empty value. When the person is not typing anything,
the empty value goes into the string variable (in this case
represented by A$ and the IF statement sends the program back to
the GET statement. This loop repeats indefinitely, until the person
operating the computer hits any key on the keyboard. At this point,
the program continues with the line following line 10.
  Add this line to the program:

  100 PRINT A$;:GOTO 10

  Now RUN the program. No cursor appears on the screen, but any
character you type will be printed on the screen. This includes all
special functions, like cursor and color controls and clearing the
screen. This two-line program can be developed into a screen
editor, shown below.
  There are many features that you could use in a screen editor. A
flashing cursor is nice to have, and can be programmed. Also, you
may wish to "trap" certain keys, like {clr/home}, so as not to
erase the screen accidentally. Or you may wish to program the
function keys for whole words. The following lines five each
function key a special purpose. Remember, this is only the
beginning of a program that you can customize for your needs, like
word processing or data capture.

  20 IF A$ = CHR$(133) THEN POKE 36879,8:GOTO 10
  30 IF A$ = CHR$(134) THEN POKE 36879,27:GOTO 10
  40 IF A$ = CHR$(135) THEN A$ = "DEAR SIR:" +
             CHR$(13)
  50 IF A$ = CHR$(136) THEN A$ = "SINCERELY," +
             CHR$(13)

  The CHR$ numbers in the parentheses come from the CHR$
code chart in the Appendix, which lists a different number for each
key character. The four function keys are activated here to perform
the tasks represented by the instructions which immediately follow
the word THEN in each line ... of course you could designate
different keys by changing the CHR$ number in parentheses, and
different instructions after the THEN statement.

HOW TO CRUNCH BASIC
PROGRAMS

  You can pack more instructions - and power - into your BASIC
programs by making each program as short as possible. This
process of shortening programs is called "crunching."
  Crunching programs lets you squeeze the maximum possible
number of instructions into your program. It also helps you reduce
the size if programs which might not otherwise run in a given size;
and if you're writing a program which requires the input of data such
as inventory items, numbers or text, a short program will leave more
memory space free to hold data.
  But whether you're using an unexpanded VIC or a 32K VIC
System, your programs will benefit from the following crunching
techniques.

ABBREVIATING KEYWORDS

  A list of keyword abbreviations is given in the Appendix A. This is
helpful when you program because you can actually crowd more
information on each line using abbreviations. The most frequently
used abbreviation is the question mark (?) which is the BASIC
abbreviation for the PRINT command. However, if you LIST a
program that has abbreviations, the VIC will automatically print out
the listing with the full-length keywords. If any program line exceeds
88 characters (4 lines on the screen) with the keywords
unabbreviated, and you want to change it, you will have to re-enter
that line with the abbreviations before saving the program.
SAVEing a program incorporates the keywords without inflating
any lines because BASIC keywords are tokenized by the VIC.
Usually, abbreviations are added after a program is written and do
not have to be LISTed any more before SAVEing.

SHORTENING PROGRAM LINE NUMBERS

  Most programmers start their programs at line 100 and number
each line at intervals of 10 (i.e., 100, 120, 130). This allows extra
lines of instruction to be added (111, 112, etc.) as the program is
developed. One means of crunching the program after it is
completed is to change the line numbers to the lowest numbers
possible (i.e., 1, 2, 3) because longer line numbers take more
memory than shorter numbers. For instance, the number 100 uses

                                    79
~
3 bytes of memory (one for each number) while the number 1 uses
only 1 byte.

PUTTING MULTIPLE INSTRUCTIONS ON
EACH LINE

  You can put more than one instruction on each numbered line in
your programs by separating them by a colon. The only limitation is
that all the instructions on each line, including the colons, should not
exceed the standard 88-character line length. Here is an example
of two programs, before and after crunching:

BEFORE CRUNCHING:       AFTER CRUNCHING:
10 PRINT "HELLO...";    10 PRINT"HELLO...";:FOR
                           T=1TO500:NEXT:PRINT
20 FORT=1TO500:NEXT        "HELLO,AGAIN...":GOTO10
30 PRINT"HELLO,AGAIN..."
40 GOTO10

REMOVING REM STATEMENTS
  REM statements are helpful in reminding yourself - or showing
other programmers - what a particular section of a program is
doing. However, when the program is completed and ready to use,
you probably won't need those REM statements anymore and you
can save quite a bit of space by removing the REM statements. If
you plan to revise or study the program structure in the future, it's a
good idea to keep a copy on file with the REM statements intact.

USING VARIABLES
  If a number, word or sentence is used repeatedly in your program
it's usually best to define those long words or numbers with a one or
two letter variable. Numbers can be defined as single letters. Words
and sentences can be defined as string variables using letter and
dollar sign. Here's one example:

BEFORE CRUNCHING        AFTER CRUNCHING
10 POKE 36878,15        10 POKE36878,15:S=36874
20 POKE 36874,200       30 POKES,200:POKES,250:POKES,
30 POKE 36874,250          150
40 POKE 36874,150

                                    80
~
USING READ AND DATA STATEMENTS
  Large amounts of data can be typed in as one piece of data at a
time, over and over again...or you can print the instructional part
of the program ONCE and print all the data to be handled in a long
running list called the DATA statement. This is especially good for
crowding large lists of numbers into a program.

USING ARRAYS AND MATRICES
  Arrays and matrices are similar to DATA statements in that long
amounts of data can be handled as a list, with the data handling
portion of the program drawing from that list, in sequence. Arrays
differ in that a list can be two or three dimensional.

ELIMINATING SPACES
  One of the easiest ways to reduce the size of your program is to
eliminate all the spaces. Although we often include spaces in
sample programs to provide clarity, you actually don't need any
spaces in your program and will save space if you eliminate them.

USING GOSUB ROUTINES
  If you use a particular line or instruction over and over, it might be
wise to GOSUB to the line from several places in your program,
rather than write the whole line or instruction every time you use it.

USING TAB AND SPC
  Instead of PRINTing several cursor commands to position a
character on the screen, it is often more economical to use the TAB
and SPC instruction to position words or characters on the screen.

                                    81

WORKING WITH GRAPHICS

  The graphics ability of the VIC 20 is more powerful and
sophisticated than many users realize. The following material is a
concept-by-concept guide to help you make better use of these
graphics features to enhance your games and other programs.

CHARACTER MEMORY

  Each character is formed in an 8-by-8 grid of dots, where each
dot may be either "on" or "off." The character images are stored in 
a special chip called the "Character Generator ROM." The
characters are stored as a set of 8 bytes for each character, with
each byte representing the dot pattern of a row in the character, and
each bit representing a dot. A zero (0) bit means that dot is off, and
a one (1) bit means the dot is on.

  The character memory in ROM begins at location 32768. The
first 8 bytes contain the pattern for the @ sign, which has a
character code value of zero on the screen. The next 8 bytes, from
location 32776 to 32783, contain the information for forming the
letter A.

      IMAGE              BINARY           PEEK
       * *              00011000           24
     *     *            00100100           36
   *         *          01000010           66
   * * * * * *          01111110           126
   *         *          01000010           66
   *         *          01000010           66
   *         *          01000010           66
                        00000000           0

  Each complete character set takes up 2k of memory, 8 bytes per
character and 256 characters. Since there are two character sets,
one for upper case and graphics, and the other with upper and lower
case, the character generator ROM takes up a total of 4k.

PROGRAMMABLE CHARACTERS

  Since the characters are stored in ROM, it would seem like there
is no way to change them for customizing the characters. However, the
memory location that tells the VIC where to find the characters is in
a RAM location in the VIC chip, which can be changed to point to

                                    82
~
many sections of memory. By changing the character memory
pointer to point to RAM, the character set may be programmed for
any need.
  The VIC's standard characters are stored as follows:

HEX      DECIMAL     DESCRIPTION
8000     32768       Upper case with full graphics
8400     33792       Upper case & graphics-reversed
8800     34816       Upper and lower case with some
                     graphics
8C00     36840       Upper & lower with some graphics-re
                     versed

  The register which contains where the chip gets is character
information is at location 36869 decimal (9005 HEX). Its value is
normally 240 (upper case and graphics) or 242 (upper/lower case). 
  The programmed character set cannot be put into expansion
RAM since the VIC chip doesn't have access to that memory.
Therefore any programmed characters must begin at a memory
location between 4096 and 7168. Since BASIC programs are
normally stored beginning at 4096, and strings start at the top of
available memory and work their way down, precautions must be
taken to protect the character set from being overwritten by BASIC.
If the BASIC program begins at 4096, the normal procedure is to
change the pointers to the top of available RAM at locations 52 and
56 so that they point below the character set. The following chart
shows the possible locations of character sets, and the POKES to
protect them.

  This table assumes that screen memory starts at 7680 (1E00).
However, it can be moved to other locations. The number of
character you have to work with at each location might change in
that case.
  There are two problems involved in creating your own special
characters. First, it is an all or nothing process. Generally, if you use
your own character set by telling the VIC chip to get the character
information from the are you have prepared in RAM, the standard
VIC characters are unavailable to you. To solve this problem, you
must copy any letters, numbers, or standard VIC graphics you
intend to use into your own character memory in RAM. You can pick
and choose, take only the ones you want, and don't even have to
keep them in order!
  The second problem with programmable characters is that your
character set takes memory space away from your BASIC
program. This is a trade off situation, since you only have a limited
amount of RAM available. If you decide to create a character set for
a program, the program has to be smaller than a program which
uses the standard VIC characters.
  There are two locations in the VIC to start your character set that
should not be used with BASIC - 0 and 4096. The first should not
be used because BASIC stores important data on page 0. The 
second can't be used because that is where your BASIC program
starts! (If you expand your VIC, or use machine language, you can
start your characters at 4096 if you want. This limit only applies to
the unexpanded VIC)
  The best place to put your character set for use with BASIC while
experimenting is at 7168. This is done by POKEing location 36869
with 255, giving you 64 characters to work with. Try the POKE now,
like this:
  POKE 36869,255
  Immediately all the letters on the screen turn to garbage. This is
because there are no characters set up at location 7168 right now
...only random bytes. Set the VIC back to normal by using the
RUN/STOP and RESTORE keys.
  Now let's begin creating graphics characters. To protect your
character set from BASIC, you should reduce the amount of
memory BASIC thinks that is has. the amount of memory in your
computer stays the same... it's just that you've told BASIC not to
use some of it.

                                    84
~
Type:
  PRINT FRE(0)
  The number displayed is the amount of memory space left
unused. Now type the following:
  POKE 52, 28: POKE 56, 28: CLR
Now type:
  PRINT FRE(0)
  See the change? BASIC now thinks it has 512 bytes less memory
to work with. The memory you just reclaimed from BASIC is where
you are going to put your character set, safe from actions of BASIC.
  The next step is to put your characters into RAM. When you
begin, there is random data beginning at 7168. You must put
character patterns in RAM (in the same style as the ones in ROM)
for the VIC to use.
  The following one line program moves 64 characters from ROM
to your character set RAM:
  FOR I = 7168 TO 7679: POKE I, PEEK(I+25600): NEXT
  Now POKE 36869 with 255, Nothing happens right? Well,
almost nothing. The VIC is now getting its character information
from your RAM, instead of ROM. But since we copied the
characters from ROM exactly, no difference can be seen... yet.
  You can easily change the characters now. Clear the screen and
type an @ sign. Move the cursor down a couple of lines, then type:
  FOR I = 7168 to 7168+7:POKE I,255 - PEEK(I): NEXT
You just created a reversed @ sign!
 
 +-----------------------------------------------------------------+
 | VIC TIP: Reversed characters are just characters with their bit |
 | patterns in character memory reversed!                          |
 +-----------------------------------------------------------------+

  Now move the cursor up to the program again and hit return
again to re-reverse the character (bring it back to normal), By
looking at the table of screen display codes, you can figure out
where in RAM each character is. Just remember that each
character takes eight memory locations to store.
  Here are a few examples just to get you started:

 +-----------+-----------+---------------------------+
 | CHARAC-   | DISPLAY   | CURRENT STARTING LOCATION |
 |  TER      |  CODE     |           IN RAM          |
 +-----------+-----------+---------------------------+
 |     @     |    0      |           7168            |
 |     A     |    1      |           7176            |
 |     !     |    33     |           7432            |
 |     >     |    62     |           7664            |
 +-----------+-----------+---------------------------+

                                    85
~
  Remember that we only took the first 64 character though.
Something else will have to be done if you want one of the other
characters.
  What if you wanted character number 154, a reversed Z? Well,
you could make it yourself by reversing a Z, or you could copy the
set of reversed characters from the ROM, or just take the one
character you want from ROM and replace one of the characters
you have in RAM that you don't need.
  Suppose you decide that you won't need the > sign. Lets
replace the > sign with the reversed Z. Type this:
  FOR I = 7664 TO 7671: POKE I, PEEK(I+26336): NEXT
  Now type a > sign. It comes up as a reversed Z. No matter how
many times you type the >, it comes out as a reversed Z. (This
change is really an illusion. Though the > sign looks like a reversed
Z, it still acts like a > in a program. Try something that needs a >
sign. It will still work fine, only it will look strange.)
  A quick review: We can now copy characters from ROM into
RAM. We can even pick and choose only the ones we want. There's
only one step left in programmable characters (the best step!)...
making your own characters.
  Remember how characters are stored in ROM? Each character
is stored as a group of eight bytes. The bit patterns of the bytes
directly control the character. If you arrange 8 bytes, one on top of
another, and write out each byte as eight binary digits, it forms an
eight-by-eight matrix, looking like the characters. When a bit is a
one, there is a dot at that location. When a bit is a zero, there is a
space at that location.
  When creating your own characters, you set up the same kind of
table in memory. Type in this program:
  10 FOR C = 7328 TO 7335: READ A: POKE C, A: NEXT
  20 DATA 60, 66, 165, 129, 165, 153, 66, 60
  Now type RUN. The program will replace the letter T with a smile
face character. Type a few T's to see the face. Each of the numbers
in the DATA statements in line 20 is a row in the smile face character.
The matrix for the face looks like this:

          7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0    DECIMAL   BINARY
ROW 0         * * * *          60     00111100
    1       *         *        66     01000010
    2     *   *     *   *     165     10100101
    3     *             *     129     10000001
    4     *   *     *   *     165     10100101
    5     *     * *     *     153     10011001
    6       *         *        66     01000010
ROW 7         * * * *          60     00111100

                                    86
~
  The sheet on this page will help you design your own characters.
There is an 8-by-8 matrix on the sheet, with row numbers, and
numbers at the top of each column. (If you view each row as a
binary word, the numbers are the value of that bit position. Each is a
power of 2. The leftmost bit is equal to 128 or 2 to the 7th power, the
next is equal to 64 or 2 to the 6th, and so on, until you reach the
rightmost bit (bit 0) which is equal to 1 or 2 to the 0th power.)
  Place an X on the matrix at every location where you want a dot to
be in your character. When your character is ready you can create
the DATA statement for your character.
  Begin with the first row. Wherever you placed an X, take the
number at the top of the column and write it down. When you have
the number for every column of the first row, add them together.
Write this number down, next to the row. This is the number that you
will put into the DATA statement to draw this row.
  Do the same thing with all of the other rows (1-7). When you are
finished you should have 8 numbers between 0 and 255. If any of
your numbers are not within range, recheck your addition. The
numbers must be in this range to be correct! If you have less than 8
numbers, you missed a row. It's OK if some are 0. The 0 rows are
just as important as the other numbers.

  Replace the numbers in the DATA statement in line 20 with the
numbers you just calculated, and RUN the program. Then type a T.
Every time you type it, you see your own character!
  if you don't like the way the character turned out, just change the
numbers in the DATA statement and re-RUN the program until you
are happy with your character.
  That's all there is to is!

HIGH RESOLUTION GRAPHICS

  When writing games or other types of programs, sooner or later
you get to the point at which you want a high resolution display, or
smooth movement of objects on the screen. A regular character
can move one space at a time, which is 8 rows or columns of dots. 
For smoother movement, characters should be moved one row of
dots at a time, using high-resolution graphics.
  The VIC can handle this need: high resolution is available
through bit mapping the screen. Bit mapping is the name of the
method where each possible dot (pixel) of resolution on the screen
is assigned its own bit in memory. If that memory bit is a one, the dot
it is assigned to is on. If the bit is set to zero, the dot is off. You can bit
map the entire screen of the VIC, or only a portion of it. You can mix
HI-RES, programmable characters and regular graphics.
  High resolution has a few drawbacks, which is why it is not used
all the time. It takes a lot of memory to bit map the entire screen.
Because every pixel must have a memory bit to control it, you are
going to need one bit of memory per pixel (or one byte for 8 pixels).
Since each character is 8-by-8, and there are 23 lines of 22
characters, the resolution is 176 by 184 for the whole screen. That
gives you 32386 separate dots, each of which requires a bit in
memory, or 4048 bytes of memory needed to map the whole
screen.
  Fear not, you can still use high resolution graphics on the
unexpanded VIC! You just don't bit map the entire screen. Instead
either use the rest of the screen as a border, or use it for text. A 64
dot by 64 dot screen section will be fairly easy to work with for this
section.
  generally, high resolution operations are made of many short, simple,
repetitive routines. Unfortunately, this kind of thing is rather
slow using BASIC, so high resolution routines written in BASIC are
usually rather slow. however, short, simple, repetitive routines are
exactly what machine language does best. The solution is to either
write your programs entirely in machine language (painful), or call

                                    88
~
HI-RES subroutines from your BASIC program, using the SYS
command from BASIC. That way you get both the ease of writing in
BASIC, and the speed (for graphics) of machine language. The
SUPER-EXPANDER cartridge also is available to add HI-RES
commands to VIC BASIC.
  All of the examples given in this section will be in BASIC to make
them clear. In the future, you can add the routines to your own
programs to give you easy HI-RES graphics. Now to the technical
details.
  Remember programmable characters? Well, bit mapping is
done almost the same way. When you created a programmable
character, you could watch it form before your eyes, if the character
was on the screen when you were changing it.

  To see this again, type this program in and RUN is.

  100 POKE 36869, 255
  110 FOR I = 7168 TO 7169: POKE I, PEEK(I+25600): NEXT
  120 PRINT CHR$(147)"A"
  130 FOR I = 7176 to 7183
  140 READ A: POKE I,A: NEXT
  160 DATA 60,36,36,36,36,36,255,255

  The character changed from an A to a top hat as you watched!
This is the trick behind HI-RES graphics on the VIC-making
changes directly on the character memory. When the character is
already on the screen you see the changes right away!
  The best way to set up the HI-RES display screen for the 64-dot
by 64-dot HI-RES display is to print out 64 characters in a square
box or matrix.
  Setting up the HI-RES display screen is the first step in HI-RES
graphics. The following short program section will set up the display
screen.

  Type NEW, then:

  10 POKE 36879,8: PRINT CHR$(147)
  20 FOR L = 0 TO 7: FOR M = 0 TO 7
  30 POKE 7680 + M*22 + L, L*8 + M
  40 NEXT: NEXT

  Now RUN the program. We now have 64 characters on the
screen; they can't be changed in any way, since the codes for the
letters are in ROM. If we change the character memory registers to

                                    89
~
point to RAM, however, we will be displaying memory that we can
change any way we want.
  Add the following line to the program:

  5 POKE 36849,255

  (This will give us 64 programmable characters, which we can set
up as an 8-by-8 character matrix, which will give us a 64-dot by
64-dot HI-RES screen - just what we were looking for.)
  RUN the program now. Garbage appeared on the screen
right? Just like the regular screen, we have to clear the
HI-RES screen before we use it. Printing a key won't work in
this case. Instead we have to clear out the section of memory
used for our programmable characters. Add the following
line to your program to clear the HI-RES screen:
  6 FOR I = 7168 TO 7679: POKE I, 0: NEXT

  Now RUN the program again. You should see nothing but black
on the screen - your program is a success. What we want to add
now is the means to turn dots on and off on the HI-RES screen.
  To SET a dot (turn the dot on) or UNSET a dot, you must know
how to find the correct bit in the character memory that you must set
to one. In other words, you have to find the character you need to
change, the row of the character, and which bit of the row that you
have to change. We need a formula to calculate this.
  We will use X and Y to stand for the horizontal and vertical
position of the dot. The dot where X = 0 and Y = ) is at the upper-left
of the display. Dots to the right have higher X values, and the dots
toward the bottom have higher Y values.

            0----------X----------63
            |                     |
            |                     |
            |                     |
            |                     |
            Y                     |
            |                     |
            |                     |
            |                     |
            |                     |
           63---------------------+

  The dots where 0 <= X <= 7 and 0 <= Y <= 7 are in character
number 0, which we placed at the upper-left corner of the screen.
Each character contains 64 dots, 8 rows of 8 dots each.
  These are the simple calculations to decide which dot of which
character is being altered.

  The character number is...
  CHAR = INT(X/8)*8 - INT(Y/8)

                                    90
~
  This gives the display code of the character you want to change.
To find the proper row in the character, use this formula:

  ROW = (Y/8 - INT(Y/8)) * 8

  Therefore, the byte in which character memory dot (X,Y) is
located is calculated by:

  BYTE = 7168 + CHAR*8 + ROW

  The last thing we have to calculate is which bit should be
modified. This is given by:

  BIT = 7 - (X- (INT(X/8)*8)

  To turn on any bit on the grid with coordinates (X,Y), use this line:

  POKE BYTE, PEEK (BYTE) OR (2 ^ BIT)

  Let's add these calculations to the program. In the following
example, the VIC will plot a sine curve:

50 FOR X = 0 to 63
60 Y = INT(32 + 31 * SIN (X/10))
70 CH = INT(X/8)*8 + INT(Y/8)
80 RO = (Y/8 = INT(Y/8))*8
90 BY = 7168 + 8*CH + RO
100 BI = 7 - (X- (INT(X/8)*8)
110 POKE BY, PEEK(BY) OR (2 ^ BI)
120 NEXT
130 GOTO 130

  The calculation in line 60 will change the values for the sine
function from a range of +1 to -1 to a range from 0 to 63. Lines 70
to 100 calculate the character, row, byte, and bit being affected,
using the formulas as given before. Line 130 freezes the program
by putting it into an infinite loop. When you have finished looking at
the display, just hold down RUN/STOP and hit RESTORE.
  As a further example, you can modify the sine curve program to
display a circle. Here are the lines to type to make the changes.

  55 Y1 = 32 + SQR(64*X - X*X)
  56 Y2 = 32 - SQR(64*X - X*X)
  60 FOR Y = Y1 to Y2 STEP Y2-Y1
  125 NEXT

  This will create a circle in the HI-RES area of the screen. Notice
that the rest of the screen fills up with a stripe pattern. This is
because the empty spaces on the screen are filled with character
code 32, which is normally a space - and is now one of the

                                    91
~
programmable characters in the grid. If you didn't want the screen
to fill up with that garbage, just fill the screen with characters with a
code you're not using. In this case, code 160 would work nicely,
since that points to the blank space character in ROM. Here is a line
that cleans up the rest of the screen:

  11 FOR I = 7680 to 8185: POKE I,160: NEXT

MULTI-COLOR MODE GRAPHICS

  High resolution graphics gives you control of very small dots on
the screen. Each dot in character memory can have 2 possible
values, 1 for on and 0 for off. When a dot is off, the dot the dot on the screen
is drawn with the screen color. If the dot is on, the dot is colored with
the character color for that screen position. All the dots within each
8x8 character can either have the screen color or the character
color. This limits the color resolution within that space. 
  Multi-color mode gives a solution to this problem. Each dot in
multi-color mode can be one of 4 colors: screen color, character
color, border color, or auxiliary color. the only sacrifice is in the
horizontal resolution, because each multi-color mode dot is twice
as wide as a high-resolution dot. This loss of resolution is more than
compensated for by the extra abilities of multi-color mode, like the
ability to color dots in one of 16 colors, instead of the usual 3.
  Multi-color mode is set on or off for each space on the screen, so
that multi-color graphics can be mixed with high-resolution
graphics. This is controlled in color memory. Color memory is in
locations beginning at either 37888 or 38400, depending on the
size of memory in the VIC. To find the current location of color
memory, use the formula:

  C = 37888 +4 * (PEEK (36866) AND 128)

  The memory in this location is a little different from that in the rest
of the VIC. It is wired up as nibbles instead of bytes, meaning that
each memory location has 4 bits instead of the usual 8. When
PEEKing values from this section of memory, the value should
always be ANDed with 16 to "filter out" any random bits that appear
in the upper 4 bits.
  By POKEing a number into color memory, you can change the
color of the character in that position on the screen. POKEing a
number from 0 to 7 gives the normal character colors. POKEing a
number between 8 and 15 puts the space into multi-color mode. In
other words, turning the high bit on in color memory sets multi-color
mode, and turning off the high bit in color memory sets normal (or
high-resolution) mode.
  Once multi-color mode is set in a space, the bits in the character

                                    92
~
determine which colors are displayed for the dots. For example,
here is a picture of the letter A, and its bit pattern:

                IMAGE         BIT PATTERN
                -----         -----------
                  **          00011000
                 *  *         00100100
                *    *        01000010
                ******        01111110
                *    *        01000010
                *    *        01000010
                *    *        01000010
                              00000000

  In normal or high-resolution mode, the screen color is displayed
everywhere there is a 0 bit, and the character color is displayed
where the bit is a 1. Multi-color mode uses the bits in pairs, like so:

                IMAGE         BIT PATTERN
                -----         ----------- 
                 AABB         00 01 10 00
                 BBAA         00 10 01 00
               AA    BB       01 00 00 10
               AACCCCBB       01 11 11 10
               AA    BB       01 00 00 10
               AA    BB       01 00 00 10
               AA    BB       01 00 00 10
                              00 00 00 00

  In the image area above, the spaces marked AA are drawn
in the border color, the spaces marked BB use the character
color, and the spaces marked CC use the auxiliary color. The
bit pairs determine this, according to the chart below:

             +----------+-----------------+
             | BIT PAIR | COLOR REGISTER  |
             +----------+-----------------+
             |    00    | Screen color    |
             |    01    | Border color    |
             |    10    | Character color |
             |    11    | Auxiliary color |
             +----------+-----------------+

  Turn the VIC off and on, and type this demonstration program:

  100 C - 37888 + 4 * (PEEK (36866) AND 128)
  110 POKE 36878, 11 * 16: REM SET AUX COLOR
  120 PRINT CHR$(147) "AAAAAAAAAA"
  130 FOR L = 0 TO 9

                                    93
~
  140 POKE C + L, 8
  150 NEXT

  The screen color is white, the border color is cyan, the
character color is black, and the auxiliary color is light cyan.
  You're not really putting color codes in the space for screen,
border, and auxiliary color; you're putting references to the
registers associated with those colors. This conserves memory
since 2 bits can be used to pick 16 colors (screen and auxiliary) or 8
colors (character and border). This also makes some neat tricks
possible. Simply changing one of the indirect registers will change
every dot drawn in that color. So everything thing drawn in the screen,
border, or auxiliary color can be changed on the whole screen
instantly. Here is an example using the auxiliary color:

  100 PRINT CHR$(147) CHR$(18);
  110 POKE 646, 8
  115 FOR L = 1 TO 22:PRINT CHR$(32);:NEXT
  120 POKE 646, 6
  130 PRINT "HIT A KEY"
  140 GET A$: IF A$ = "" THEN 140
  150 X = INT(RND(1)*16)
  160 POKE 36878, X*16
  170 GOTO 140

  There is a memory location in the VIC that is especially useful
with multi-color mode. Location 646 is the color that is currently
being PRINTed. When a color control key is pressed this location is
changed to the new color code. by POKEing this location, the
characters to PRINT can be changed to any color, including
multi-color characters. For example, type this command:

  POKE 646,10

  The word READY and anything else you type will be displayed in
multi-color mode. Any color control will set you back to regular text.

SUPEREXPANDER CARTRIDGE

  There is a cartridge program called the VIC SUPER EX-
PANDER. This cartridge is programmed with many special
functions, including a graphics package. This allows drawing of
lines, dots, and circles, coloring in of areas on the screen, and full
control over graphic modes. For programs in BASIC, it will be
considerably easier to use graphics with the SUPER EXPANDER
than by use of cumbersome pokes. The SUPER EXPANDER also
includes 3K of extra RAM to give you enough room to do any
high-resolution operation.

SOUND AND MUSIC

  Sound effects and music can improve almost any computer
program, whether in BASIC or Machine Language. Obviously, a
computer game is more exciting if you can hear the guns blazing
and the rockets exploding. Likewise, a clever little tune provides an
audio "theme" for a game or other program, or might become the
"reward" if the player reaches a special "high" score.
  Beyond games, sound effects serve other useful purposes. For
example, a business or calculation program may be faster and
easier to use if the computerist can enter a long string of numbers or
formulas without looking up from a chart or balance sheet. A quick
tone at the end of each entry indicates when a number has been
entered... a "buzz" might sound if the number entered has too
many decimal places... and different tones might be used to
distinguish one kind of entry from another.
  These are just a few ideas about how sound and music are used
in computer programming. The following information is provided to
help you the programmer understand how to use the VIC's sound
capability to best advantage.

FOUR "SPEAKERS" AND 5 "OCTAVES"

  The VIC has 3 tone generators (for music), and one white noise
generator (for sound effects). The tone generators cover 3 octaves
each but are staggered slightly so you can actually reach a total of 5
separate octaves.
  The VIC's speakers and volume control are stored in specific
memory locations which you can access and control by using the
POKE command. Whenever you poke one of these locations you
activate that tone generator, or the volume control.
  When programming sound - especially music - it is often helpful
to think of these various sound controls as "speakers," and the
volume setting as a standard "volume" control.
  Here, briefly, is a list of memory locations relating to sound:

  36878 (VOLUME SETTING)
  36874 (SPEAKER 1 - MUSIC - LOWEST)
  36875 (SPEAKER 2 - MUSIC - MIDDLE)
  36876 (SPEAKER 3 - MUSIC - HIGHEST)
  36877 (SPEAKER 4 - NOISE)

  There are 15 volume settings. Therefore to set the volume you must
type the POKE command, followed by a comma, and a number

                                    95
~
from 1 to 15. We suggest you always use 15, unless you're playing
with the amplitude as part of a sound effect.
  Each speaker has a range of 128 separate settings. To "play" a
particular note you must POKE one of the speaker settings, which
happen to be numbered from 128 to 255. If you POKE a number
lower than 128 or higher than 255 you will get no sound (which
suggests one way to interrupt a speaker while it's "on").
  Here's an example of how to play a note on the VIC:

  20 POKE 36878, 15      SETS VOLUME AT MAXIMUM
  30 POKE 36875, 200     TURNS ON SPEAKER NUMBER 1
  40 FOR X = 1 to 1000:  THIS IS A 1000 COUNT TIME DELAY
  NEXT
  50 POKE 36878,0        THIS TURNS THE SPEAKER OFF
                         AFTER COUNTING TO 1000
  RUN

  This VIC uses the television speaker as it's "voice," so the volume
can also be adjusted by turning the television speaker (or other
external amplifier).

ABBREVIATING THE SOUND COMMANDS

  You can abbreviate the lengthy POKE commands described above
by converting these to programming "shorthand." One way is 
shown below:

  10 V=36878:S1=36874:S2=36875:S3=36876:S4=36877

  Now if you want to turn on a particular speaker, or set volume, you
can use the abbreviations... like, for instance:

  20 POKEV,15
  30 POKES2,200
  40 FORX=1TO1000:NEXT
  50 POKEV,0

 +-----------------------------------------------------------------+
 | VICTIP                                                          |
 | In line 10, we put all the commands on one line instead of five |
 | lines because we want to demonstrate economical program-        |
 | ming techniques. You can save memory and "crunch" longer        |
 | programs into less space if you put several commands on a       |
 | single line, with each command separated by a colon, as         |
 | shown.                                                          |
 +-----------------------------------------------------------------+

                                    96
~
Keep this "programming shorthand" in mind as we show you some
more examples of using the VIC speakers.

HOW MUSIC WORKS ON THE VIC

  As already mentioned, the VIC's speakers each cover 3 octaves,
but together reach a total range of 5 octaves. This is because the
VIC's 3 tone generators are "staggered" so the octaves of the
different speakers overlap. A more graphic picture of which
speakers cover which octaves and how they overlap is shown in the
chart on page 99. Musical note values are shown below:

The Octave Chart illustrates the three octaves contained in each
speaker register. It also shows how several octaves overlap...for
instance, the lowest octave of Speaker 3 contains the same notes
as the middle octave of Speaker 2. Of course, the same note played
on different speakers may sound slightly different... just as the
same note played on a piano may sound slightly different from the same
note played on a harpsichord. Also, some television sets and
speakers may cause varying results in terms of tonal qualities.
  The Table of Musical Notes on page 97 is Intended to help you
approximate note values in your computer program using the VIC.
The number values are approximate only and may be adjusted by
using values between those shown.

MUSIC PROGRAMMING TECHNIQUES

  There are four basic parameters in programming music:
  1. Volume
  2. Speaker/Sound Register Selection
  3. Note
  4. Duration
In other words, the things you have to consider when programming
music are which volume to set, which speaker(s) to use, the notes
being played by each speaker, and the duration of each note. Let's
consider some techniques for putting these parameters in your 
program:

EXAMPLE 1: MUSIC USING DATA STATEMENT

10 POKE 36787, 15     Set volume to highest level (15)
20 S2=36875           Set speaker to equal S2 (any variable)
30 READ N,D           Read duration & note from DATA
                        below.
40 IF N=-1 THEN       Turn off speaker & end program at -1
   POKES2,0:END
50 POKES2,N           Play note N from DATA on Speaker S2
60 FORT=1TOD:         Duration loop to set up time value.
   NEXT
70 GOTO30             Keeps going back to DATA list to get
                        duration & note (N,D) values.
80 DATA 225,250,226   DATA statements...the first number
   250,227,250,228,     is the note from the note value chart
   250,229,250,230,     earlier in text, and the second
   250,231,250,232,     number is the duration the note is
   250,233,250,234,     played.
   250,235,250,-1,
   -1

Pay special attention to the fact that N,D is actually each PAIR of
values in the DATA statement in line 80. For example, 225,250 is
the note (225) and the time duration (250 jiffies) the note is played. The
next note is 226 which is also held for a duration of 250, and so on
until the computer comes to the DATA pair of -1,-1, which is the
signal to END the program. There are two ways to end the music
portion of a program. To turn off the music and continue the
program you should simply POKE the speaker(s) with a zero to turn
them off when the program reaches your DATA signal (the signal
here is -1,-1 but it could be any number). To end the entire
program when the music stops POKE the speaker(s) off with a 
zero and END the program by using the END command as shown
in line 40.

EXAMPLE 2: MUSIC USING MULTIPLE SPEAKERS

10 POKE 36878,15            This program is essentially the
20 S1=36874:S2=36875:       same as Example 1, except
   S3=36876                 several speakers are used, and
30 READ D,N1,N2,N3          each speaker must be desig-
40 IF D=-1THENPOKES1,       nated separately. If you're not
   0:POKES2,0:POKES3,       familiar with DATA statements,
   0:END                    here's a good example of how
50 POKE S1,N1               they work. In the previous ex-
60 POKE S2,N2               ample we told the VIC to scan
70 POKE S3,N3               through the DATA and READ
80 FORT=1TOD:NEXT           N,D where the first number was
90 GOTO30                   the NOTE and the second num-
100DATA500,225,225,225,     ber was the DURATION. In this
   0,0,0,0,500,225,225,225, example, we are rearranging
   500,232,232,232,0,0,0,0, the program so the VIC reads
   500,232,232,232          the DATA numbers in a slightly
110DATA250,240,240,240,     different order. Line 30 instructs
   250,239,239,239,         the VIC to READ the data in this
   125,237,237,237,         order: DURATION, NOTE 1,
   67.5,235,235,235,        NOTE 2, NOTE 3. These notes
   33,232,232,232           are only played on their corre-
120DATA33,231,231,231,      sponding speakers per lines
   33,228,228,228,          60-70. The music is the same as
   33,225,225,225           EXAMPLE 1 except we're using
   33,223,223,223,          three speakers and setting the
   500,195,195,195          same duration for all 3 notes so
130DATA500,240,240,240      they play simultaneously. If you
140DATA-1,0,0,0             want different speakers to play

                                    100
~
                            different durations, (as in most
                            songs) you would change line
                            30 to: READ D1,N1,D2,N2,D3,
                            N3 and put matching dura-
                            tion/note pairs in the DATA
                            statements. This is how you
                            achieve 3-voice harmony.

Notice also in Example 2 that the simple tune is played with all
similar notes, then speeded up by shortening the duration values.
The duration values may be any number, including decimal
numbers like the "67.6" in line 110 which is included as an example.
The note values may be any number between 128 and 255, with
notes corresponding to the note value chart earlier in this chapter.
  Another parameter which you might consider changing is
volume. An example of how volume may be changed is found in the
"OCEANWAVES" sound effect program on page 137 of the VIC 20 
Personal Computer Guide (owner's manual).
  If you want to get even more sophisticated in your music/sound
effects programming, try frequency modulation, which entails
rapidly switching back and forth between two notes to achieve the
illusion of a "middle" note between the two values. Example 3
illustrates this technique and plays a "true" scale.

  If the note values are given, vary the sound register on the VIC
between those two values. If only one value is give, don't vary the
register (just POKE the value in twice).

 | VIC TIP: Here are a few additional comments about using       |
 | DATA statements in your programs. In Example 2 (page 100)     |
 | we show each note set(duration, note1, 2 and 3) on a separate |
 | line to emphasize that the notes are arranged and played      |
 | simultaneously... when you enter this DATA in your            |
 | computer, however, you should not break up the segments       |
 | but instead type all the numbers and commas without any       |
 | spaces between the characters. Typing programs without        |
 | spaces is a good way to conserve memory and reduce the        |
 | possibility of error.                                         |

  Now when you type RUN (and press RETURN), you can play
tunes on your VIC. The keys in the top row with the numbers on them
control the various notes:

  The VIC will keep playing the note you hit last until you hit another
note. When you're done, press either 0 or 9 and it will turn off. To
start the VIC piano again, just reRUN the program.

 Try the following:

THE WHITE NOISE GENERATOR

  One of the "speakers" we've ignored thus far is the White Noise
Generator, or Speaker 4. This fourth speaker produces a blank
noise sound like that on your television set when you fall asleep late
at night. It has the same 3 octave range as the tone generators
described above, and is used primarily for sound effects, either by
itself or in conjunction with the other speakers. The combination of
white noise and tones can produce some stunning effects. Twenty
or so sample sound effects are listed in the VIC 20 owner's manual
(PERSONAL COMPUTING ON THE VIC 20).

                                    104

  To try out the White Noise generator, try typing this:

  10 POKE36878,15    (if you don't have vol on yet)
  20 POKE36877,240
  30 FORT=1TO1000:NEXT
  50 POKE36877,0

 +-------------------------------------------------------------------+
 | VIC TIP:                                                          |
 | If you turn a particular speaker on it will STAY ON UNTIL YOU     |
 | TURN IF OFF. Example: POKE 36875,200 turns Speaker 2 on           |
 | with a high-pitched tone. You must POKE 36875,0 to turn the       |
 | speaker off. Just POKEing the Volume to zero will not turn the    |
 | speaker off. For example, turn the volume on (POKE36878,15)       |
 | then POKE a speaker on. Now turn the volume off                   |
 | (POKE 36878,0) then turn it on again (POKE 36878,15). The tone    |
 | comes back on again automatically, right? That's because it       |
 | was never turned off. Just the volume was turned to zero. It's    |
 | like a radio set on the same station. Whenever you turn the       |
 | volume up the same station comes on. You have to turn the         |
 | speaker to a different tone, turn it off by pokeing zero, or poke |
 | it to a number outside of it's range to get a "silent" reading    |
 | (under 128).                                                      |

SYSTEM OVERVIEW

  This chapter provides an overall functional description of the VIC
20 and ties hardware and software operations together to give the
programmer more of an understanding of the way VIC 20
processes his program within the system.
  A simplified functional block diagram of the computer is shown in
Figure 1-1. The major system components include the micropro-
cessor, the program-storage read-only memories (ROMs), the
data-storage random-access memories (RAMs), the versatile
interface devices (VIAs, 6522), the character generator chip
(2332), and the VIC chip which provides video and sound for the
display.
  The 6502 microprocessor is the most complex device on the
electronics printed circuit board. This device is primarily responsi-
ble for controlling all computer operations. These operations are
controlled by addressing programs in the read-only memory
(ROM), and then interpreting and executing these sequential
program instructions. The interpretation and execution of instruc-
tions are accomplished during the processor's fetch and execute
cycles. In the fetch cycle, a program instruction is "fetched" into the
processor's instruction register. The program counter (indicates
the location of the instruction in ROM) is counted up, ready for the
next instruction which performs the operation indicated. Addresses
indicating the destination of data being transferred are derived from
the instruction, or calculated using program data and data from the
internal registers.
  These controls exercised by the processor are performed by
communicating through the 16-bit address bus, the 8-bit bi-direc-
tional data lines, and the write-enable line. The information on the
address bus determines the destination of the data being
transferred, the bi-directional data bus functions as a path for data
transferred into and out of the microprocessor, and the write-enable
line determines the direction of the data being transferred.
  Consider the microprocessor's inputs and outputs. We can
divide these into three groups. Each of these groups forms a "bus"
which consists of a set of parallel paths used to transfer binary
information between the devices in the system.
  The address bus is used to carry the address generated by the
microprocessor to the address inputs of the memory and
input/output (I/O) devices.

  The data bus consists of eight bi-directional data lines. During a
write operation, these lines transfer data from the processor to a
memory location selected by the address lines. During a read
operation, data is transferred from memory to the processor along
the same lines. The data bus is, therefore, used to carry all data and
instructions to and from the processor, memory, and the peripheral
devices.
  To understand the operation of the control lines which comprise
the control bus, we will examine one individually. Since the data bus
is bi-directional, the processor must have some method of
signaling to memory or I/O to which direction data transfer will take
place (whether memory or the I/O is to be read or written to). This
function is performed by the R/W (Read/Write) output from the
processor. When this line is high, all data transfers will take place
from memory to the processors - a read operation. If the R/W line is
low, then the processor will write data out to memory.
  Other control lines which comprise the control bus are: system
clock timing - used to time the operation of the system including
data transfers; reset (RST) line - used to initialize the processor
when the machine is switched on; and interrupt (IRQ and NMI)
lines - used to cause the processor to stop its current program and
start a new program at a specified location.
  The program memory is the storage for the sequence of BASIC
instructions which comprise the system programs. The micropro-
cessor fetches these instructions by placing the appropriate
address on the address bus. In response, the memory puts the
instruction, in the form of a pattern of 1's and 0's, on the data bus.
  The program memory is called a read-only memory because the
microprocessor cannot store information into the ROM device.
However, by addressing the ROM, the processor can cause the
corresponding 8 bits of data to be transferred on the data bus. The
ROM is a nonvolatile device, i.e., data is not destroyed when power
is disconnected from the system.
  The read-write, random-access memory (RAM) provides tem-
porary storage for input data, arithmetic operations, and other data
manipulations. Each RAM address corresponds to eight memory
cells. However, when power is removed from the system, all
RAM-stored data is lost; the RAM is therefore a volatile memory
device.
  The versatile interface adapter provide interface for the
keyboard, user-port, control port, and the serial bus. The serial bus
provides the communication for peripheral units, such as floppy
disk drives, printers and etc. Each port is assigned a unique
address to permit communications with the microprocessor (Figure
3-3).

  The video interface chip (VIC) implements color video graphics
for the system. It provides all circuitry necessary for generating
color programmable character graphics with high resolution. VIC
also incorporates sound effects and A/D converter to accommo-
date video games. Its on-chip sound system includes three
independent, programmable tone generators, a white-noise
generator and an amplitude modulator.
  The VIC 20 character generator contains all characters used in
the system. There are two complete character sets used: (1) Upper
case with full graphics, and (2) upper case and lower case with
limited graphics. Also, each of these character sets is represented
in its reverse mode. These characters are stored in the ASCII 6-bit
code and are arranged in 8x8 bit cells. Also, each character is
stored every 8 bytes in memory. The diagram in Figure 3-4
shows the character generator memory layout.
  VIC's 6502 microprocessor can access up to 32,000 indepen-
dent user-RAM memory locations (with memory expansion). You
can think of VIC's memory as a book with up to 256 "pages," with
256 memory locations on each page. For example, page $80 is the
256 memory locations beginning at location $8000 and ending at
location $80FF. Since the 6502 uses two 8-bit bytes to form the
address of any memory location, you can think of one of the bytes
as the page number and the other as the location within the page.
  The amount of active RAM may be 3.58K (addresses 4096 to

24K more RAM (addresses 8192 to 37267. Addresses 40960 to
49151 are allocated for the expansion of ROM. The first 1K-byte
allocation (to 1024) is fixed; the larger the memory size, the more
space is available in the user program area.
  VIC has three types of memory: random-access memory (RAM),
read-only memory (ROM), and input/output locations (I/O). Figure
3-5 shows a typical VIC 20 memory, the different types, and the
operations for which they are used.
  Each portion of the memory is described in more detail in the
following text.
  The first 1K-byte of RAM (Addresses 0 - 1023) is allocated
to working storage, the stack, and tape buffers. Byte ad-
dresses 4096 through 8191 are allocated to screen storage
and storage of user programs (Figure 3-6).
  Locations 256 through 511 are used for the stack area of BASIC,
KERNAL and the microprocessor. The stack begins at location 511
and proceeds downward. Storage is allocated dynamically as
needed by BASIC and the hardware. An OUT-OF-MEMORY error
occurs if the stack pointer reaches the end of available space in this
area.
  Locations 512 through 827 are used as additional BASIC and
KERNAL working-storage locations.
  Locations 828 through 1023 form a tape buffer area for the tape
cassette.

  Location 65535 is the end of the VIC memory.
  The VIC BASIC interpreter executes a user program by
interpreting each source line stored in memory in its compressed
form. First, however, a discussion about how the program is stored
in memory is necessary.
  When a program line is entered from the keyboard, the screen
editor takes control, allowing you to edit the line until you press the
RETURN key. When the RETURN key is pressed, the BASIC
interpreter performs two actions: first, the program line is translated
into its compressed form, that is, reserved words and logical-opera-
tor keywords are represented by their one-byte tokens; then the
interpreter stores the program line in memory in its ascending line
number order. When the RETURN key is pressed, the BASIC
interpreter searches memory for the same line number. If there is
not a line with the same line number, the next higher line number is
encountered and the interpreter then inserts the new line into
memory.
  Program lines are stored at the beginning of the user program
area of memory which starts at memory location 4096. Variables
are stored in memory above the program lines, and arrays are
stored above the variables. All three areas begin at lower
addresses and build upwards to higher addresses. Strings are
stored beginning at the top of memory and works downwards. The
BASIC interpreter builds all four areas, moving them as necessary
and adjusting pointers for insertions and deletions. Eight pairs of
memory locations contain pointers to the division points in the user
program area of memory. These pointers are shown in Figure 3-9.

  Next we will discuss the formats in which BASIC statements,
variables, arrays, and strings are stored in their respective areas.
  The BASIC statement storage table (Figure 3-10) shows the
format in which BASIC statements are stored. Memory location
4097 contains a pointer to the beginning of the first BASIC
statement. The pointer, like all addresses in the VIC, is stored in
low-byte, high-byte order. The pointer is a link to the memory
address of the next link. A link address of zero denotes the end of
the text; i.e., there are no more links and no more statements.
BASIC statements are stored in order of ascending line numbers,
even though there are links to the next statement. Links are used to
quickly search through line numbers.
  The statement line number (stored in low-byte, high-byte
order) follows the link address. Line numbers go from 0 to
63999 (stored as 0 and 0, and 255 and 249 respectively).

           Figure 3-10. BASIC statement storage.

  After the line number, the BASIC statement text begins.
Reserved words and logical-operator keywords are stored in a
compressed format. A one-byte token is used to represent a
keyword. All keywords are encoded such that the high-order bit is
set to 1. Other elements of the BASIC text are represented by their
stored ASCII code. Other elements are comprised of constants,
variable and array names, and special symbols other than
operators and are coded just as they appear in the original BASIC
statement. The BASIC keywords table (Table 3-1) shows the byte
codes for all values from 0 to 255 that may appear in the
compressed BASIC text. Codes are interpreted according to this
table except after an odd number of double quotation marks

  Note that the left parenthesis is stored as part of the one-byte
token for functions TAB and SPC; however, the other functions use
a separate byte for this symbol. For example, the line

  10 IF INT(A)<5 THEN PRINT TAB(X)

would be coded as the following bytes (in decimal):

             IF   INT                   THEN   PRINT   TAB(

  The operators (+-*/<=> as well as the words AND, OR, and
NOT are given keyword codes (high-order bit set) since they
"drive" the BASIC interpreter just as reserved words do (e.g., 179
for <). The standard ASCII codes for these symbols (e.g., 60 for <)
appear only in the text of a string.
  Spaces in the source line are stored except for the space
between the line number and first keyword. This space is supplied
on LISTing when a stored statement is expanded to its original
form. You can conserve memory storage space by eliminating
blanks (but this makes the program harder to read). You can also
conserve space by putting more than one statement on a line, since
the five bytes of link, line number, and 0 end byte are stored only
once.
  The size of each statement is variable and is terminated by a byte
of zero to indicate the end of the statement. (An ASCII zero
anywhere within the text is stored as 48.) Zero-byte flags are used
by the BASIC interpreter in executing a program when it goes
through the compressed BASIC text from left to right picking out
keywords and performing the indicated operations. A zero byte
indicates the end of the statement; the next four bytes are the link
to the line number of the statement. Instead of search-
ing through the text and using 0 byte indicators to locate the
next statement, links are used when searching the state-
ments for their line numbers. Three consecutive bytes of
zero (the last statement's 0 byte followed by two zero link
bytes) flag the end of text when executing the program.
  A program stored onto cassette tape is in the same format as
shown in figure 3-10 for memory storage. Therefore, it is basically
"dumped" onto tape in a continuous block, including link addresses
and 0 end bytes.
  The use of tokens in place of keywords is not unique to the VIC,
but there is no standard coding from one interpreter to another.
Thus, a BASIC source program SAVEd on tape by VIC BASIC is
not compatible with other BASICs, nor can BASIC programs
generated on other (non-CBM) machines normally be loaded by
the VIC BASIC interpreter.

INTRODUCTION TO MACHINE
LANGUAGE

WHAT IS MACHINE LANGUAGE?

  At the heart of every microcomputer, there is a central
microprocessor, a very special microchip which is the "brain" of the
computer. The VIC 20's microprocessor is the 6502 chip. Every
microprocessor understands its own language of instructions, and
these instructions are called the machine language instructions of
that chip. To put it more precisely, machine language is the ONLY
programming language that your VIC 20 really understands. It is
the native language of the machine.
  If machine language is the only language that the VIC 20
understands, then how does it understand the VIC BASIC
programming language? If VIC BASIC is not the machine language
of the VIC 20, what makes the VIC 20 understand VIC BASIC
instructions such as PRINT and GOTO?
  To answer this question, we must first see what happens to your
VIC 20 when you turn it on. How does your computer know what to
do when it is first turned on? Well, apart from the microprocessor
which is the brain of the VIC 20, there is a huge machine language
program which is "burnt" into a special type of memory called ROM
that cannot be changed, and does not get erased when the VIC 20
is turned off, unlike a program that you put into the VIC's RAM. This
huge program is in two parts, one taking care of the BASIC
language, and the other called the "operating system."
  The operating system is in charge of "organizing" all the memory
in your machine for various tasks, looks at what characters you type
on the keyboard and puts them onto the screen, and a whole
number of other functions. The operating system can be thought of
as the "intelligence and personality" of the VIC 20 (or any computer
for that matter). So when you turn on your VIC 20, the operating
system takes control of your machine, and after it has done its
housework, it then says:

  READY
  *

  The operating system of the VIC 20 then allows you to type on the
keyboard, and use the built-in "screen editor" on the VIC 20. The
screen editor allows you to move the cursor, DELete, INSert, etc.,
and is, in fact, only one part of the operating system that is built-in
for your convenience.

                                    123
~
  All of the commands that are available in VIC BASIC are simply
recognized by another huge machine language program built into
your VIC 20. This huge program "RUN"'s the appropriate piece of
machine language depending on which VIC BASIC command is
being executed. This program is called the "BASIC interpreter,"
because it interprets each commands, one by one, unless it
encounters a command that it does not understand, and than the
familiar message appears:

  ?SYNTAX
  ERROR
  READY.
  *

WHAT DOES MACHINE CODE LOOK LIKE?

  You should be familiar with the PEEK, and POKE commands in
the CBM BASIC language for changing memory locations. You will
probably have used them for graphics on the screen, and for sound
effects. The memory locations will have been 36874, 36875,
36876, 36877, 36878 for sound effects. This memory location
number is known as the "address" of a memory location. If you can
imagine the memory in the VIC 20 as a street of houses, the number
on the door is, of course, the address. Now we will look at which
parts of the street are used for which purpose.

            machine language programs, or both, are stored.
            This is also where the screen memory would begin
  to        on a VIC 20 that has at least 8K of RAM expansion
            memory, in which case the screen RAM that
            follows would become user memory space,
 7679       continuing up to the top of the expansion memory.

  Don't worry if you don't understand what the description of each
part of memory means. This will become clear from other parts of
this manual.
  Machine language programs consist of instructions which may or
may not have operands (parameters) associated with them. Each
instruction takes up one memory location, and any operand will be
contained in one or two locations following the instruction.
  In your BASIC programs, words like PRINT, and GOTO do, in
fact, only take up one memory location, rather than one for each
character of the word. The contents of the location that represents a
particular BASIC keyword is called a "token." In machine language,

                                    125
~
there are different tokens for different instructions, which also take
up just one byte (memory location = byte).
  Machine language instructions are very simple, i.e., each
individual instruction cannot achieve a great deal. Machine
language instructions either change the content of a memory
location, or change one of the internal registers (special storage
locations) inside the microprocessor. The internal registers form
the very basis of machine language.

REGISTERS INSIDE THE 6502
MICROPROCESSOR

THE ACCUMULATOR - This is THE most important register in the
microprocessor. Various machine language instructions allow you
to copy the contents of a memory location into the accumulator, or
copy the contents of the accumulator into a memory location, or
modify the contents of the accumulator or some other register
directly, without affecting any memory. Also, the accumulator is the
only register that has instructions to perform math on it.

THE X INDEX REGISTER - There are instructions to do nearly all
of the transformations you can do to the accumulator, and other
instructions to do things that only the X register can do. Again,
various machine language instructions allow you to copy the
contents of a memory location into the X register, or copy the
contents of the X register into a memory location, or modify the
contents of the X, or some other register directly, without affecting
any memory.

THE Y INDEX REGISTER - There are instructions to do nearly all
of the transformations you can do to the accumulator, and the X
register, and other instructions to do things that only the Y register
can do. Again, various machine language instructions allow you to
copy the contents of a memory location into the Y register, or copy
the contents of the Y register into a memory location, or modify the
contents of the Y, or some other register directly, without affecting
any memory.

THE STATUS REGISTER - This register consists of eight "flags"
(a flag = something that indicates that something has, or has not,
occurred).

THE PROGRAM COUNTER - This contains the address of the
current machine language instruction being executed. Since the

                                    126
~
operating system is always "RUN"ning in the VIC 20 (or for that
matter, any computer), the program counter is always changing. It
could only be stopped by halting the microprocessor in some way.

THE STACK POINTER - This register contains the location of the first
empty place on the stack. The stack is used for temporary storage
by machine language programs, and by the computer.

THE TOOLS AVAILABLE; GETTING
READY...

How Can You Write Machine Language Programs?

  Since machine language programs reside in memory, and there
is no facility in your VIC 20 for writing and editing machine language
programs, you must use either a program to do this, or write for
yourself a BASIC program that "allows" you to write machine
language.
  Most commonly used to write machine language programs are
"assemblers." These packages allow you to write machine
language instructions in a standardized "mnemonic" format, which
makes the machine language program a good deal more readable
than a stream of numbers. To recap: A program that allows you to
write machine language programs in mnemonic format is called an
"assembler," and also, a program that displays a machine
language program in mnemonic format is called a "disassembler."
Available for your VIC 20 is a machine language monitor cartridge
(with assembler/disassembler, etc.) made by Commodore.

VICMon

  The VICMon cartridge available from your local dealer is a
program that allows you to escape from the world of VIC BASIC,
into the land of machine language. It can display the contents of the
internal registers in the 6502 microprocessor, and it allows you to
display portions of memory, and change them on the screen, using
the screen editor. It also has a built-in assembler and disassembler,
and many other features that allow you to write and edit machine
language programs easily.
  You don't HAVE to use an assembler to write machine language,
but the task is considerably easier with it. If you wish to write
machine language programs, it is advised strongly that you buy an
assembler of some sort. Without an assembler you will probably
have to "POKE" the machine language program into memory,
which, if you value your sanity, is totally inadvisable. This manual

                                    127
~
will give examples in the format that VICMon uses from now on.
Nearly all assembler formats are the same, therefore the machine
language examples shown will almost certainly be compatible with
any assembler other than the one incorporated in VICMon.

Hexadecimal Notation

  This is a notation which most machine language programmers
refer to when referring to a number or address in a machine
language program.
  Some assemblers let you refer to addresses and numbers in
decimal (base 10), binary (base 2), or even octal (base 8) as well as
hexadecimal (or just "hex" as most people say). These assemblers
do the conversions for you.
  Hexadecimal will probably seem a little hard to grasp at first, but
like most things it doesn't take long (with practice) to master it.
  By looking at decimal (base 10) numbers, you will see that each
digit in that number ranges between zero and a number equal to the
base less one, i.e., > 9 THIS IS TRUE OF ALL NUMBER BASES.
Binary (base 2) numbers have digits ranging from zero to one
(which is one less than the base). Similarly hexadecimal numbers
should have digits ranging from zero to fifteen, but we do not have
any single digit figures for the number ten to fifteen, so the first six
letters of the alphabet are used instead:

DECIMAL        HEXADECIMAL                BINARY
   0         --       0         --       00000000
   1         --       1         --       00000001
   2         --       2         --       00000010
   3         --       3         --       00000011
   4         --       4         --       00000100
   5         --       5         --       00000101
   6         --       6         --       00000110
   7         --       7         --       00000111
   8         --       8         --       00001000
   9         --       9         --       00001001
  10         --       A         --       00001010
  11         --       B         --       00001011
  12         --       C         --       00001100
  13         --       D         --       00001101
  14         --       E         --       00001110
  15         --       F         --       00001111
  16         --      10         --       00010000
 etc.

  If that's confusing, let's try to look at it another way:

                                    128
~
 +--------------------------------------------------------------+
 | Example of how a base 10 (decimal number) is constructed.    |

 |                     -----------------                        |
 | Equals:.............1000   100  10  1                        |

 | Consider 4569 (base 10) 4 5 6 9 = 4x1000 + 5x100 + 6x10 + 9  |
 +--------------------------------------------------------------+

 +--------------------------------------------------------------+
 | Example of how a base 16 (hexadecimal number) is             |
 | constructed.                                                 |
 |                                                              |
 | Base raised by         3    2   1   0                        |
 | increasing powers.. 16   16   16   16                        |
 |                     -----------------                        |
 | Equals:.............4096   256  16  1                        |
 |                     -----------------                        |
 | Consider 11D9 (base 16) 1 1 D 9 = 1*4096 + 1*256 + 13*16 + 9 |
 +--------------------------------------------------------------+

Therefore 4569 (base 10) = 11D9 (base 16)

  The range for addressable memory locations is 0 - 65535 (as
was stated earlier). This range is therefore 0 - FFFF in
hexadecimal notation.
  Usually hexadecimal numbers are prefixed with a dollar sign, to
distinguish them from decimal number. Let's look at some "hex"
numbers, using VICMon by displaying the contents of some
memory. VICMon shows you:

B*
   PC   SR AC XR YR SP
.; 0401 32 04 5E 00 F6 (these may be different)

  Then you type in:
.M 0000 0020 (and press RETURN).

  You will see rows of 6 hex numbers. The first 4 digit one is the
address of the first byte of memory being shown in that row, and the
other five numbers are the actual contents of the memory locations
beginning at that start address.
  You should endeavor to learn to "think" in hexadecimal. This is
not difficult, since there is no need to think in decimal. For example,
if it is said that a particular value is stored at $14ED instead of 5357,
this shouldn't cause any headaches.

INSTRUCTION

"LDA" - Load the Accumulator

  In 6502 assembly language, mnemonics are always three
characters. LDA represents "load accumulator with...", and what
the accumulator should be loaded with is decided by the
parameter(s) associated with that instruction. The assembler
knows which token is represented by each mnemonics, and when it
"assembles" an instruction, it simply puts into memory (at whatever
address has been specified), the token and what parameters are
given. Some assemblers give error messages, or warnings when
the user has tried to assemble something that either the assembler
or the 6502 microprocessor cannot do.
  If we put a "#" symbol in front of the parameter associated with
the instruction, this means that we wish the register specified in the
instruction to be loaded with the "value" after the "#". For
example: -

  LDA #$05

  This instruction will put $05 (decimal 5) into the accumulator
register. The assembler will put into the specified address for this
instruction, $A9 (which is the token for this particular instruction, in
this mode), and it will put $05 into the next location after the location
containing the instruction ($A9).
  If the parameter to be used by an instruction has "#" before it,
i.e., the parameter is a "value," rather than the contents of a
memory location, or another register, the instruction is said to be in
the "immediate" mode. To put this into perspective, let us compare
this with another mode.
  If we want to put the contents of memory location $102E into the
accumulator, we are using the "absolute" mode of instruction:

  LDA $102E

  The assembler can distinguish between the two different modes
because the latter does not have a "#" before the parameter. The
6502 microprocessor can distinguish between the immediate
mode and the absolute mode of the LDA instruction because they
have slightly different tokens. LDA (immediate) has $A9 (as stated
previously), and LDA (absolute) has $AD.
  The mnemonic representing an instruction usually implies what it
does. For instance, if we consider another instruction, "LDX," what
do you think this does?
  If you said "load the X register with...", go to the top of the class.

                                    130

If you didn't, then don't worry; learning machine language does take
patience, and cannot be accomplished in a day.
  The various internal registers can be thought of as special
memory locations, because they too can hold one byte of
information. It is not necessary for us to explain the binary
numbering system (base 2) since it follows the same rules as
outlined for hexadecimal and decimal outlined previously, but one
"bit" is one binary digit and eight bits make up one byte.
  The maximum number that can be contained in a byte is the
largest number that an eight digit binary number can be. This
number is 11111111 (binary), which equals to $FF (hexadecimal),
which equals 255 (decimal). You have probably wondered why only
numbers from zero to two hundred and fifty-five could be put into a
memory location. If you try to POKE 7680,260 (which is the BASIC
statement that "says": - "Put the number two hundred and sixty
into memory location seven thousand, six hundred and eighty."
The BASIC interpreter knows that only numbers 0 - 255 can be put
in a memory location, and your VIC 20 will reply with:

  ?ILLEGAL QUANTITY
   ERROR
  READY.
  *

  If the limit of one byte is $FF (hex), how is the address parameter
in the absolute instruction "LDA $102E" expressed in memory?
  Well, it is expressed in two bytes (it won't fit into one, of course).
The lower (rightmost) two digits of the hexadecimal address form
the "low byte" of the address, and the upper (leftmost) two digits
form the "high byte."
  The 6502 requires any address to be specified with its low byte
first, and then the high byte. This means that the instruction "LDA
$102E" is represented in memory by the three consecutive values:

  $AD, $2E, $10

  We need to know one more instruction before we can write our
first program. That instruction is "BRK." For a full explanation of this
instruction, refer to M.O.S 6502 Programming Manual. You can
think of it as the "END" instruction in machine language.
  If we write a program with VICMon and put the BRK instruction at
the end, the program will return to VICMon when it finished. This
might not happen if there is a mistake in your program, or if the BRK
instruction is never reached (just like an "END" statement in BASIC
may never get executed, and thus if the VIC 20 didn't have a STOP
key, you wouldn't be able to abort your BASIC programs!)

                                    131

WRITING YOUR FIRST PROGRAM

  If you have used the POKE statement in BASIC to put characters
onto the screen, you will be aware that the character codes for
POKEing are different to CBM ASCII character values. For
example, if you enter:

  PRINT ASC("A") (and press <RETURN>)

The VIC 20 will respond with:

  65
  READY.
  *

  However, to put an "A" onto the screen by POKEing, the code is
1. Since the screen memory starts at 7680 (decimal), or 4096 if you
have 8K or more of expansion memory, by entering:

  <CLR> (To clear the screen)
  POKE 7680,1 (and <RETURN>)  (NOTE: POKE 4096,1 on a
                               VIC 20
                               with 8K or more of
                               expansion memory)

  The "P" in the POKE statement should now be an "A." We will
now do this is machine language. Type the following in VICMon:

(Your cursor should be flashing alongside a "." right now.)
 .A 1400 LDA #$01 (and press <RETURN)

The VIC will prompt you with:
  .A 1402 *

Type:
  .A 1402 STA $1E00  (or STA $1000 on a VIC 20
                      with 8K or more of expansion memory)

  The STA instruction stores the contents of the accumulator in a
specified memory location. The VIC will now prompt you with:
  .A 1405 *

Now enter:
  .A 1405 BRK

Clear the screen, and type:
  G 1400

                                    132
~
  The G should turn into an "A" if you have done everything
correctly. You have now written your first machine language
program! Its purpose is to store one character, the letter A, in the
first byte of screen memory.

ADDRESSING MODES

ZERO PAGE

  As shown earlier, absolute addresses are expressed in terms of
a high order and a low order byte. The high order byte is often
referred to as the page of memory. For example, the address $1637
is in page $16 (22), and $0277 is in page $02 (2). There is, however,
a special mode of addressing known as "zero page" addressing
and it is, as the name implies, associated with the addressing of
memory locations in page zero. These addresses have a high order
byte of zero. The zero page mode of addressing only expects one
byte to describe the address, rather than two when using an
absolute address, which saves speed and time. This mode tells the
microprocessor to assume that the high order address is zero.
Therefore zero page addressing can reference memory locations
whose addresses are between $0000, and $00FF.

THE STACK

  The 6502 microprocessor (like almost all others) has what is
known as a "stack." This is used both by the programmer and the
microprocessor to temporarily remember things, and to remember
the order of events. The GOSUB statement in BASIC, which allows
the programmer to call a "subroutine," must remember where it is
being called from. When the RETURN statement is executed in the
subroutine, the BASIC interpreter "knows" where to go back in
order to continue executing. When a GOSUB statement is
encountered in a program by the BASIC interpreter, the BASIC
interpreter "pushes" its current position onto the stack before going
to do the subroutine, and when a RETURN is executed, the
interpreter "pulls" from the stack the information that tells it where it
was before the subroutine call was made, so that it may continue as
if nothing had happened. The interpreter uses instructions like PHA
which will push the contents of the accumulator onto the stack, and
PLA (the inverse) which will pull a value off the stack into the
accumulator. The status register can also be pushed and pulled
with the PHP, and PLP respectively.
  The stack is 256 bytes long, and is located in page one of
memory. It is therefore from $0100 to $01FF. It is organized

                                    133
~
backwards in memory, i.e., the first position in the stack is at $01FF,
and the last is at $0100. Another register in the 6502 microproces-
sor that hasn't been mentioned yet is called the "stack pointer," and
it always points at the next available location in the stack. When
something is pushed onto the stack, it is placed where the stack
pointer points to, and the stack pointer is moved down to the next
position (decremented). When something is pulled off the stack, the
stack pointer is incremented, and the byte pointed to by the stack
pointer (at $0100 offset by the contents of the stack pointer) is
placed into the specified register.
  Up to this point, we have covered immediate, zero page, and
absolute mode instructions. We have also covered (but have not
stated) the "implied" mode, which means that the instruction itself
tells what registers/flags/memory the instruction is referring to. The
examples we have seen are PHA, PLA, PHP, and PLP, which refer
to stack processing and the accumulator and status registers.
  The X register will be referred to as X from now on, and similarly
with A - accumulator, Y - Y index register, S - stack pointer, and
P - processor status).

INDEXING

  Indexing plays an extremely important part in the running of the
6502 microprocessor. It can be defined as "creating an actual
address from a base address plus the contents of either the X or Y
index registers."
  For example, if X contains $05, and the microprocessor executes
an LDA instruction in the "absolute X indexed mode" with base
address, e.g., $9000, then the actual location that is loaded into the
A register is $9000 + $05 = $9005. The mnemonic format of an
absolute indexed instruction is the same as an absolute instruction
except a ",X" or ",Y" denoting the index is added to the address,
e.g.:
  LDA $9000,X

INDIRECT INDEXED ADDRESSING

  This mode allows the program to choose a memory location from
256 adjacent locations. The address of the lowest location is stored
in zero page, and the value in the Y register is added to that address
to choose the final address.
  For example, we will place a $45 in location $01, and a $1E in
location $02. We will use the instruction to load the accumulator in
the indirect indexed mode, specifying zero page address $01 as the

                                    134
~
location where the address to be used is held. Then the actual
address will be comprised of:

  low address byte = contents of $01 - $45
  high address byte = contents of $02 - $1E

  The actual address = $1E45 + Y = $1E55
  If you think of indexed addressing like delivering junk mail
through a post office, here is the principle for indirect indexed
addressing:

  We will deliver the letter to all the houses on the block starting at
$1E00 Memory St. and continuing for 256 houses. Here is the
equivalent program for VICMon:

.A 1200 LDA #$00        load low order actual address
.A 1202 STA $01         set the low byte of the first indirect
                        address
.A 1204 STA $FE         set the low byte of the second address
.A 1206 LDA #$1E        load high order indirect address
.A 1208 STA $02         set the high byte of the first indirect
                        address
.A 120A LDA #$96        load the second address's high byte
.A 120C STA $FF         set the high byte of the second address
.A 120E LDY #$00        set the indirect index (Y)
.A 1210 LDA #$66        66 is the value of our "letter" to the first
                        "block"
.A 1212 STA ($01),Y     store the "letter" in the house on the
                        first "block"
.A 1214 LDA #$0A        0A is the value of our second "letter"
.A 1216 STA ($FE),Y     store the "letter" in the house on the
                        second "block"
.A 1218 INY             add 1 to index
.A 1219 BNE $1210       branch back & send next letter
.A 121B BRK             return to VICMon when done
.G 1200                 sends the "letter" - fills the top of the
                        screen with blue & red lines!

INDEXED INDIRECT ADDRESSING

  This mode allows the program to choose an address from a table
in page zero. Since page zero space is limited to 256 bytes, this is a
mode that isn't used too often.
  This mode only works with the X register. It is like indirect
indexed, except that the zero page location is indexed, rather than
an address stored in zero page. Therefore, the address stored in

                                    135
~
page zero is the actual address because the index has already
been used in the indirection.
  Let us fill location $05 with $45, and location $06 with $1E. If the
instruction to load the accumulator in the indexed indirect mode is
executed and the specified zero page address is $01, then the
actual address will be comprised of:

  low order = contents of ($01 + X)
  high order = contents of ($02 + X)
  X register = $04

Thus the actual address will be in = $01 + X = $05
  Therefore, the actual address will be the indirect address
contained in $05 and $06 which is $1E45.
  This is like sending a mailing to a specified list of addresses. We
will store a list in zero page, and send the "letter" only to those in the
list. Suppose the list of addresses starts at $00. Here is a program
to send a "letter" to one of the addresses:

LDA #$00          -- load low order actual base address
STA $06           -- set the low byte of the indirect address
LDA #$16          -- load high order indirect address
STA $07           -- set the high byte of the indirect address
LDX #$06          -- set the indirect index (X)
LDA ($00,X)       -- load indirectly indexed by X

BRANCHES AND TESTING

  Another very important principle in machine language is the
ability to test, and detect certain conditions, in a similar fashion to
the "IF...THEN" structure in VIC BASIC.
  The various "flags" in the status register are affected by different
instructions in different ways. For example, there is a flag that is set
when an instruction has caused a zero result, and is reset when a
result is not zero.

  LDA #$00

  This instruction will cause "the zero result flag" to be set,
because the instruction has resulted in the accumulator containing
a zero.
  There is a set of instructions that will, given a particular condition,
"branch" to another part of the program. An example of a branch
instruction is "BEQ", which means "branch if result equals to zero."
The branch instruction will "branch" if the condition is true, and if
not, the program will continue onto the next instruction, as if nothing
had occurred. The branch instruction branch not by the result of

                                    136
~
the previous instruction(s), but by internally examining the status
register.
  As was just mentioned, there is a "zero result" flag in the status
register. The "BEQ" instruction branches if the "zero result" flag
(known as "Z") is set. Every branch instruction has an opposite
branch instruction. The BEQ instruction has an opposite instruction
"BNE" ("branch on result NOT equal to zero, i.e., "Z" not set).
  The index registers have a number of associated instructions
which modify their contents. For example, the "INX" instruction will
"increment the X index register." If the X register contained $FF
before it was incremented (the maximum number the X register can
contain), it will "wrap around" back to zero. If we wanted a program
to continue to do something until we had performed the increment
of the X index that pushed it around to zero, we could use the BNE
instruction to continue "looping" around, until X became zero.
  Apart from INX, there is "DEX", which will decrement the X index
register. If it is zero, it will wrap around to $FF. Similarly, there are
"INY" and "DEY" for the Y index register.
  But what if a program didn't want to wait until X or Y had reached
(or not reached) zero? Well there are comparison instructions,
"CPX" and "CPY", which allow the machine language programmer
to test the index registers with specified values, or even the
contents of memory locations. If we wanted to see if the X register
contained $40, we would use the instruction:

CPX #$40             compare X with the "value" $40.
BEQ (some other      branch to somewhere else in the program, if
     part of the     this condition is "true."
     program)

  The compare and branch instruction play a major part in any
machine language program.
  The operand specified in a branch instruction when using
VICMon is the address of the part of the program the branch should
go to, if taken. However, the operand is only, if fact, an "offset" from
where the program currently is, to the address specified. This offset
is just one byte, and therefore the range that a branch instruction
can branch to is limited from 128 bytes backwards, to 127 bytes
forward; this is a total range of 255 bytes, which is, of course, the
maximum range of values one byte can contain. VICMon will tell
you if you branch out of range, by refusing to "assemble" that
instruction. It is unlikely that you will be doing such huge branches
for quite a while anyway. For nearly all situations this is adequate
anyway. The branch is a "quick" instruction by machine language
standards because of this "offset" principle as opposed to an

                                    137
~
absolute address. VICMon allows you to type in an absolute
address, and it calculates the correct offset. This is just one of the
"comforts" of using an assembler.

Subroutines

  In machine language (in the same way as using BASIC), you can
call subroutines. The instruction to call a subroutine is "JSR" (jump
to subroutine), followed by the specified absolute address.
  Incorporated in the operating system is a machine language
subroutine that will PRINT a character to the screen. The CBM
ASCII code of the character should be in the accumulator before
calling the subroutine. The address of this subroutine is $FFD2.
  Therefore, to print "HI" to the screen, the following program
should be entered:

.A 1400 LDA #$48        load the CBM ASCII code of "H"
.A 1402 JSR $FFD2       print it
.A 1405 LDA #$49        load the CBM ASCII code of "I"
.A 1407 JSR $FFD2       print that too
.A 140A LDA #$0D        print a carriage return as well
.A 140C JSR $FFD2
.A 140F BRK             return to VICMon.
.G 1400                 will print "HI" and return to VICMon

  The "PRINT a character" routine we have just used is part of the
KERNAL "jump table." The instruction similar to GOTO in BASIC,
is "JMP," which means "jump to the specified absolute address."
The KERNAL is a long list of "standardized" subroutines that
control ALL input and output of the VIC 20. Each entry in the
KERNAL JMP's to a subroutine in the operating system. This "jump
table" resides at $FF84 to $FFF5 in the operating system. A full
explanation of the KERNAL is in the "KERNAL REFERENCE
SECTION" in this manual, but certain routines will be used here to
show how easy, and effective, the KERNAL is.
  We will now use these new principles in another program which
will help you to put these instructions into context:
  This program will display the alphabet using a KERNAL routine.
  The only new instruction introduced here is TXA "transfer the
contents of the X index register, into the accumulator."

.A 1400 LDX #$41        X = CBM ASCII of "A".
.A 1402 TXA             A = X.
.A 1403 JSR $FFD2       print character.
.A 1406 INX             bump count.
.A 1407 CPX #$51        have we gone past "Z"?

                                    138
~
.A 1409 BNE $1402       no - go back and do more.
.A 140B BRK             yes - return to VICMon.

  To see the VIC print the alphabet, type the familiar command:

  .G 1400

  The comments that are beside the program explain the program
flow, and logic. If you are writing a program, write it on paper first,
and test it in small parts if possible.

SPECIAL TIPS FOR BEGINNERS

  Learning to write machine language programs is a discipline
which is very useful in programming. Since machine language is at
the same level as the internal workings of the machine, your brain is
stretched that much further, when trying to organize things in your
mind and in the VIC-20.
  One of the best ways to learn machine language is to look at
other people's machine language programs. These are published
all the time, in magazines and newsletters, even if the article is for a
different computer that also has the 6502 microprocessor (there
are many). You should make sure that you thoroughly understand
the code that you look at. This may require perseverance,
especially when you see a new technique that you have never
came across before. This can be infuriating, but if patience prevails,
you will be the VICtor (sorry about that).
  Having looked at other machine language programs, you MUST
write your own. These may be utilities for your BASIC programs, or
may be an all machine language program. You should also use the
utilities that are available, either in your computer, or in a program,
that aid you in writing, editing, or tracking down errors in a machine
language program. An example would be the KERNAL, which
allows you to check the keyboard, print text, control peripheral
devices like disk drives, printers, modems, etc., manage memory
and the screen. It is extremely powerful and it is advised strongly
that it is used (refer to KERNAL section).

ADVANTAGES OF WRITING PROGRAMS IN
MACHINE LANGUAGE

  1. Speed - Machine language is hundreds, and in some cases
thousands of times faster than a high level language such as
BASIC.
  2. Tightness - A machine language program can be made totally
"watertight," i.e., the user can be made to do ONLY what the
program allows, and no more. With a high level language, you are
relying on the user not "crashing" the BASIC interpreter by
entering, for example, a zero which later causes a:

  ?DIVISION BY ZERO
  ERROR IN LINE 830
  READY.

In essence, the computer belongs to the machine language
programmer.

APPROACHING A LARGE TASK

  When approaching a large task in machine language, a certain
amount of subconscious thought has usually taken place, in
thinking about how certain processes would be implemented in
machine language. When the task is started, it is usually a good
idea to set out on paper block diagrams of memory usage,
functional modules of code required, and a program flow. Let's say
that we wanted to write a roulette game in machine language. We
can outline this as shown below.

  Display title
  Ask if player requires instructions
  YES - display them - Go to START
  NO - Go to START
  START Initialize everything
  MAIN display roulette table
  Take in bets
  Spin wheel
  Slow wheel to stop
  Check bets with result
  Inform player
  Player any money left
  YES - Go to MAIN
  NO - Inform user!, and Go to START

  This is the main outline, which, as each module is approached,
can then be broken down further. If you look upon a large
indigestible problem as something that once broken down into
small enough pieces can all be eaten, then this will enable you to
approach something that seems impossible, and you will be
surprised at how swiftly it all falls into place. This process obviously
improves with practice, but KEEP TRYING.

MEMORY MAPS

The following memory maps provide a guide which shows which
special locations are set aside for use by the VlC's operating
system...and what those locations are used for.

USEFUL MEMORY LOCATIONS

  This is a more in-depth guide to some of the memory locations
you can use.

HEX               DECIMAL        DESCRIPTION

 0014-0015        20-21          Where BASIC stores integer variables
                                   used in calculations. The fixed-float and
                                   float-fixed routines (vectors at 1-2 and
                                   3-4) use the value in this area.
 002B-002C        43-44          The start of the BASIC program in
                                   memory. Location 43 contains the low
                                   byte, and location 44 has the high byte.
                                   To compute the start of BASIC in
                                   decimal, use the formula: PEEK(43) +
                                   256 * PEEK(44)
 002D-002E        45-46          The start of the numeric variables,
                                   which is usually immediately after the
                                   end of the BASIC program.
 002F-0030        47-48          The start of arrays in memory, usually
                                   immediately following the numeric vari-
                                   ables.
 0031-0032        49-50          The end of the arrays in memory.
 0033-0034        51-52          Bottom of string storage, moving from
                                   the top of available memory down to the
                                   top of arrays.
 0037-0038        55-56          The top of free RAM. By lowering this
                                   value, some RAM can be "protected"
                                   against BASIC putting values here.
 0043-0044        67-68          Jump vector for INPUT statement.
 0061-0066        97-102         Floating point accumulator #1 for cal-
                                   culations.
 0069-006E        105-110        Floating point accumulator #2.
 0073-008A        115-138        The CHRGET subroutine resides here.
                                   This routine gets the next BASIC
                                   character from machine language.
 0090             144            Status word ST.
 0098             152            Number of open files.
 0099             153            Device number for input, normally 0
                                   (keyboard).
 009A             154            Output (CMD) device, normally 3
                                   (screen).

HEX               DECIMAL        DESCRIPTION

 00A0-00A2        160-162        3 byte jiffy clock. The Tl and Tl$
                                   variables are translations of these loca-
                                   tions.
 00B2-00B3        178-179        Points to the start of the tape buffer. Can
                                   be used as an indirect zero-page jump
                                   to a routine in the buffer.
 00B7             183            Number of characters in filename.
 00B9             185            Which secondary address is currently
                                   being used.
 00BA             186            Current device number being accessed.
 00BB-00BC        187-188        Points to location of filename in memo-
                                   ry.
 00C5             197            Current key being held down. There will
                                   be a 64 here if nothing is held down. If
                                   more than 1 key is down, the key with
                                   the highest number on the chart is what
                                   shows up here.

                                   be as if the characters were typed from
                                   the keyboard.

                                   dore sets the 2 bit, and the CTRL sets
                                   the 4 bit.

THE KERNAL

  One of the toughest problems facing programmers in the
microcomputer field is the question of what to do when changes are
made to the operating system of the computer by the company.
Machine language programs which took much time to develop
might no longer work, forcing major revisions in the program. To
alleviate this problem, Commodore has developed a method of
protecting software writers called the KERNAL.
  Essentially, the KERNAL is a standardized JUMP TABLE to the
input, output and memory management routines in the operating
system. The locations of each routine in ROM might change as the
system is upgraded. But the KERNAL jump table will be changed to
match. If your machine language routines only use the system
ROM routines through the KERNAL, it will take much less work to
modify them. The KERNAL is the operating system of the VIC
computer. All input, output, and memory management are
controlled by the KERNAL.
  To simplify the machine language program you write, and to
make sure that future versions of the VIC operating system don't
make your machine language programs obsolete, the KERNAL
contains a jump table for you to use. By taking advantage of the 39
input/output routines and other utilities accessible from the table,
not only will you save time, but you will also make it easier to
translate your programs from one Commodore computer to
another.
  The jump table is located on the last page of memory, in
read-only memory.
  To use the KERNAL jump table, first you set up the parameters
that the KERNAL routine needs to work. Then JSR to the proper
place in the KERNAL jump table. After performing its function, the
KERNAL transfers control back to your machine language
program. Depending on which KERNAL routine you are using,
certain registers may pass parameters back to your program. The
particular registers for each KERNAL routine may be found in the
individual descriptions of KERNAL subroutines.
  A good question at this point is why use the jump table at all? Why
not just JSR directly to the KERNAL subroutine involved? The jump
table is used so that if the KERNAL or BASIC is changed, your
machine language programs will still work. In future operating
systems the routines may be moved in memory...but the jump
table will still work correctly!

                                    182

HOW TO USE THE KERNAL

  When writing machine language programs it is often convenient
to use the routines which are already part of the operating system
for input/output, access to the system clock, memory management,
and similar operations. It is an unnecessary duplication of effort to
write these routines again, so easy access to the operating system
helps speed machine language programming.
  As mentioned before, the KERNAL is a jump table. This is just a
collection of JMP instructions to many operating system routines.
  To use a KERNAL routine you must first make all preparations
that the routine demands...if the routine says that you must have
called another KERNAL routine first, than that routine must be
called. If the routine expects you to put a number in the
accumulator, than that number must be there. Otherwise your
routines have little chance of working the way you expect them to
work.
  After all preparations are made, you must call the routine by
means of the JSR instruction. All KERNAL routines you can access
are structured as SUBROUTINES, ending with an RTS instruction.
When the KERNAL routine has finished its task, control will be
returned to your program at the instruction after the JSR.
  Many of the KERNAL routines return error codes in the status
word or the accumulator in case of problems. Good programming
practice and the success of your machine language programs
demand that you handle this properly. If you ignore an error return,
the rest of your program might bomb.
  That's all there is in using the KERNAL - these three steps -

  1. Set up
  2. Call the routine
  3. Error handling

  The following conventions are used in describing the KERNAL
routines.
FUNCTION NAME: Name of the KERNAL routine.
CALL ADDRESS: This is the call address of the KERNAL routine,
given in hexadecimal.
COMMUNICATION REGISTERS: Registers listed under this
heading are used to pass parameters to and from the KERNAL
routines.
PREPARATORY ROUTINES: Certain KERNAL routines require
that data be set up before they can operate. The routines needed
are listed here.

                                    183
~
ERROR RETURNS: A return from a KERNAL routine with the
CARRY set indicates than an error was encountered in processing.
The accumulator will contain the number of the error.
STACK REQUIREMENTS: This is the actual number of stack
bytes used by the KERNAL routine.
REGISTERS AFFECTED: All registers used by the KERNAL
routine are listed here.
DESCRIPTION: A short tutorial on the function of the KERNAL
routine is given here.

  The list of the KERNAL routine follows.

B-1. Function name: ACPTR
  Purpose: Get data from the serial bus
  Call address: $FFA5
  Communication registers: .A
  Preparatory routines: TALK, TKSA
  Error returns: See READST
  Stack requirements: 13
  Registers affected: .A, .X
  Description: This is the routine to use to get information from a
device on the serial bus (like the disk). This routine gets a byte of
data off the serial bus using full handshaking. The data is returned
in the accumulator. To prepare for this routine the TALK routine
must have been called first to command the device on the serial bus
to send data on the bus. If the input device needs a secondary
command, it must be sent by using the TKSA KERNAL routine
before calling this routine. Errors are returned in the status word.
The READST routine is used to read the status word.
  To use this routine:
  0) Command a device on the serial bus to prepare to send data
to the VIC.
  (Use the TALK and TKSA KERNAL routines).
  1) Call this routine (using JSR)
  2) Store or otherwise use the data.

                                    185

EXAMPLE:
  Get a byte from the bus
  1) JSR ACPTR
  2) STA DATA

B-2. Function name: CHKIN
  Purpose: Open a channel for input
  Call address: $FFC6
  Communication registers: .X
  Preparatory routines: (OPEN)
  Error returns: 3,5,6
  Stack requirements: None
  Registers affected: .A, .X
  Description: Any logical file that has already been opened by
the KERNAL OPEN routine can be defined as an input channel by
this routine. Naturally, the device on the channel must be an input
device. Otherwise, an error will occur, and the routine will abort.
  If you are getting data from anywhere other than the keyboard,
this routine must be called before using either the CHRIN or the
GETIN KERNAL routines for data input. If input from the keyboard
is desired, and no other input channels are opened, then the calls to
this routine, and to the OPEN routine, are not needed.
  When this routine is used with a device on the serial bus, this
routine automatically sends the talk address (and the secondary
address if one was specified by the OPEN routine) over the bus.
  To use this routine:
  0) OPEN the logical file (if necessary; see description above).
  1) Load the .X register with number of the logical file to be used.
  2) Call this routine (using a JSR command).

  Possible errors are:
  #3: File not open
  #5: Device not present
  #6: File not an input file

EXAMPLE:
  ; PREPARE FOR INPUT FROM LOGICAL FILE 2
  1) LDX #2
  2) JSR CHKIN

B-3. Function name: CHKOUT
  Purpose: Open a channel for output
  Call address: $FFD9
  Communication registers: .X

                                    186
~
  Preparatory routines: (OPEN)
  Error returns: 3,5,7
  Stack requirements: None
  Registers affected: .A, .X
  Description: Any logical file number which has been created by
the KERNAL routine OPEN can be defined as an output channel.
Of course, the device you intend opening a channel to must be an
output device. Otherwise, an error will occur, and the routine will be
aborted.
  This routine must be called before any data is sent to any output
device unless you want to use the VIC screen as your output
device. If screen output is desired, and there are no other output
channels already defined, then the calls to this routine, and to the
OPEN routine are not needed.
  When used to open a channel to a device on the serial bus, this
routine will automatically send the LISTEN address specified by the
OPEN routine (and a secondary address if there was one).
  How to use: Remember: this routine is NOT NEEDED to send
data to the screen. 0) Use the KERNAL OPEN routine to specify a
logical file number, a LISTEN address, and a secondary address (if
needed).
  1) Load the .X register with the logical file number used in the
open statement.
  2) Call this routine (by using the JSR instruction)
    ; DEFINE LOGICAL FILE 3 AS AN OUTPUT CHANNEL
    1) LDX #3
    2) JSR CHKOUT

  Possible error returns:
  3: File not open
  5: Device not present
  7: Not an output file

B-4. Function name: CHRIN
  Purpose: Get a character from the input channel
  Call address: $FFCF
  Communication registers: .A
  Preparatory routines: (OPEN, CHKIN)
  Error returns: See READST
  Stack requirements: None
  Registers affected: .A, .X
  Description: This routine will get a byte of data from the channel
already set up as the input channel by the KERNAL routine CHKIN.

                                    187
~
If the CHKIN has not been used to define another input channel,
data is expected from the keyboard. The data byte is returned in the
accumulator. The channel remains open after the call.
  Input from the keyboard is handled in a special way. First, the
cursor is turned on, and will blink until a carriage return is typed on
the keyboard. All characters on the line (up to 88 characters) will be
stored in the BASIC input buffer. Then the characters can be
retrieved one at a time by calling this routine once for each
character. When the carriage return is retrieved, the entire line has
been processed. The next time this routine is called, the whole
process begins again, i.e., by flashing the cursor.
  How to use:
  FROM THE KEYBOARD
  1) Call this routine (using the JSR instruction).
  2) Retrieve a byte of data by calling this routine.
  3) Store the data byte.
  4) Check if it is the last data byte (is it a CR?). If not, go to step 2.

EXAMPLE:
  1)    LDX #$00     ; Store 00 in the .X register
  2) RD JSR CHRIN
        STA DATA,X   ; store the Xth data byte in the Xth
        INX          ; location in the data area
  3)    CMP #CR      ; Is is a carriage return?
  4)    BNE RD       ; no, get another data byte

EXAMPLE:
   JSR CHRIN
   STA DATA

FROM OTHER DEVICES
  0) Use the KERNAL OPEN and CHKIN routines.
  1) Call this routine (using a JSR instruction)
  2) Store the data

EXAMPLE:
  JSR CHRIN
  STA DATA

B-5. Function name: CHROUT
  Purpose: Output a character
  Call address: $FFD2

                                    188
~
  Communication registers: .A
  Preparatory routines: (CHKOUT, OPEN)
  Error returns: See READST
  Stack requirements: None
  Registers affected: None
  Description: This routine will output a character to an already
opened channel. Use the KERNAL OPEN and CHKOUT routines
to set up the output channel before calling this routine. If this call is
omitted, data will be sent to the default output device (number 3, on
the screen). The data byte to be output is loaded into the
accumulator, and this routine is called. The data is then sent to the
specified output device. The channel is left open after the call.
  NOTE: Care must be taken when using routine to send
data to a serial device since data will be sent to all open output
channels on the bus. Unless this is desired, all open output
channels on the serial bus other than the actually intended
destination channel must be closed by a call to the KERNAL
close channel routine.
  How to use:
  0) Use the CHKOUT KERNAL routine if needed (see
description above).
  1) Load the data to be output into the accumulator.
  2) Call this routine.

EXAMPLE:
                  ; Duplicate the BASIC instruction CMD 4,"A";
  LDX #4          ; LOGICAL FILE #4
  JSR CHKOUT      ; OPEN CHANNEL OUT
  LDA #'A
  JSR CHROUT      ; SEND CHARACTER

B-6. Function name: CIOUT
  Purpose: Transmit a byte over the serial bus
  Call address: $FFA8
  Communication registers: .A
  Preparatory routines: LISTEN [SECOND]
  Error returns: See READST
  Stack requirements: None
  Registers affected: .A
  Description: This routine is used to send information to devices
on the serial bus. A call to this routine will put a data byte onto the
serial bus using full serial handshaking. Before this routine is called,
the LISTEN KERNAL routine must be used to command a device

                                    189
~
on the serial bus to get ready to receive data. (If a device needs a
secondary address, it must also be sent by using the SECOND
KERNAL routine.)
  The accumulator is loaded with a byte to handshake as data on
the serial bus. A device must be listening or the status word will
return a timeout. This routine always buffers one character. (The
routine holds the previous character to be sent back.) So when a
call to the KERNAL UNLSN routine is made to end the data
transmission, the buffered character is sent with EOI set. Then the
UNLSN command is sent to the device.
  How to use:
  0) Use the LISTEN KERNAL routine (and the SECOND routine
if needed).
  1) Load the accumulator with a byte of data.
  2) Call this routine to send the data byte.

EXAMPLE:
  ; Send an X to the serial bus
  LDA #'X
  JSR CIOUT

B-7. Function name: CLALL
  Purpose: Close all files
  Call address: $FFE7
  Communication registers: None
  Preparatory routines: None
  Error returns: None
  Stack requirements: 11
  Registers affected: .A, .X
  Description: This routine closes all open files. When this routine
is called, the pointers into the open file table are reset, closing all
files. Also, the routine automatically resets the I/O channels.
  How to use:
  1) Call this routine

EXAMPLE:
  ; USED AT START OF EXECUTION FOR INITIALIZATION
  JSR CLRCHN ; CLOSE FILES
  JMP RUN ; BEGIN EXECUTION

B-8. Function name: CLOSE
  Purpose: Close a logical file
  Call address: $FFC3

                                    190
~
  Communication registers: .A
  Preparatory routines: None
  Error returns: None
  Stack requirements: None
  Registers affected: .A, .X
  Description: This routine is used to close a logical file after all I/O
operations have been completed on that file. This routine is called
after the accumulator is loaded with the logical file number to be
closed (the same number used when the file was opened using the
OPEN routine).
  How to use:
  1) Load the accumulator with the number of the logical file to be
closed.
  2) Call this routine.

EXAMPLE:
  ; CLOSE 15
  LDA #15
  JSR CLOSE

B-9. Function name: CLRCHN
  Purpose: Clear I/O channels
  Call address: $FFCC
  Communication registers: None
  Preparatory routines: None
  Error returns: None
  Stack requirements: 9
  Registers affected: .A, .X
  Description: This routine is called to clear all open channels and
restore the I/O channels to their original default values. It is usually
called after opening other I/O channels (like to the disk or tape
drive) and using them for input/output operations. The default input
device is 0 (keyboard). The default output device is 3 (the VIC
screen).
  If one of the channels to be closed is to the serial port, an
UNTALK signal is sent first to clear the input channel or an
UNLISTEN is sent to clear the output channel. By not calling this
routine (and leaving listener(s) active on the serial bus) several
devices can receive the same data from the VIC at the same time.
One way to take advantage of this would be to command the printer
to TALK and the disk to LISTEN. This would allow direct printing of a
disk file.

  How to use:
  1) Call this routine using the JSR instruction

EXAMPLE:
  JSR CLRCHN

B-10. Function name: GETIN
  Purpose: Get a character from the keyboard buffer
  Call address: $FFE4
  Communication registers: .A
  Preparatory routines: None
  Error returns: None
  Stack requirements: None
  Registers affected: .A, .X
  Description: This subroutine removes one character from the
keyboard queue and returns it as an ASCII value in the
accumulator. If the queue is empty, the value returned in the
accumulator will be zero. Characters are put into the queue
automatically by an interrupt driven keyboard scan routine which
calls the SCNKEY routine. The keyboard buffer can hold up to ten
characters. After the buffer is filled, additional characters are
ignored until at least one character has been removed from the
queue.
  How to use:
  1) Call this routine using a JSR instruction
  2) Check for a zero in the accumulator (empty buffer)
  3) Process the data

EXAMPLE:

B-11. Function name: IOBASE
  Purpose: Define I/O memory page
  Call address: $FFF3
  Communication registers: X, Y
  Preparatory routines: None
  Error returns: None
  Stack requirements: 2
  Registers affected: .X, .Y
  Description: This routine will set the X and Y registers to the
address of the memory section where the memory mapped I/O
devices are located. This address can then be used with an offset to

                                    192
~
access the memory mapped I/O devices in the VIC. The offset will
be the number of locations from the beginning of the page that the
desired I/O register is located. The .X register will contain the low
order address byte, while the .Y register will contain the high order
address byte.
  This routine exists to provide compatibility between the VIC 20
and future models of the VIC. If the I/O locations for a machine
language program are set by a call to this routine, they should still
remain compatible with future versions of the VIC, the KERNAL and
BASIC.
  How to use:
  1) Call this routine using the JSR instruction.
  2) Store the .X and the .Y register in consecutive locations.
  3) Load the .Y register with the offset.
  4) Access that I/O location.

EXAMPLE:
  ; Set the data direction register of the user port to 0 (input)

B-13. Function name: LOAD
  Purpose: Load RAM from device
  Call address: $FFD5
  Communication registers: .A, .X, .Y
  Preparatory routines: SETLFS, SETNAM
  Error returns: 0,4,5,8,9
  Stack requirements: None
  Registers affected: .A, .X, .Y
  Description: This routine will load data bytes from any input
device directly into the memory of the VIC. It can also be used for a
verify operation, comparing data from a device with the data
already in memory, leaving the data stored in RAM unchanged. The
accumulator (.A) must be set to 0 for a load operation, or 1 for a
verify. If the input device was OPENed with a secondary address
(SA) of 0, the header information from device will be ignored. In this
case, the .X and .Y registers must contain the starting address for
the load. If the device was addressed with a secondary address of
0, 1 or 2 the data will load into memory starting at the location
specified by the header. This routine returns the address of the
highest RAM location which was loaded.
  Before this routine can be called, the KERNAL SETLFS, and
SETNAM routines must be called.
  How to use:
  0) Call the SETLFS, and SETNAM routines. If a relocated load
is desired, use the SETLFS routine to send a secondary address of
3.
  1) Set the .A register to 0 for load, 1 for verify
  2) If a relocated load is desired, the .X and .Y registers must be
set to the start address for the load.
  3) Call the routine using the JSR instruction.

B-21. Function name: SAVE
  Purpose: Save memory to a device
  Call address: $FFD8
  Communication registers: .A, .X, .Y
  Preparatory routines: SETLFS, SETNAM
  Error returns: 5,8,9
  Stack requirements: None
  Registers affected: .A, .X, .Y
  Description: This routine saves a section of memory. Memory is
saved from an indirect address on page 0 specified by the
accumulator to the address stored in the .X and .Y registers to a
logical file (an input/output device). The SETLFS and SETNAM
routines must be used before calling this routine. However, a file
name is not required to SAVE to device 1 (the cassette tape
recorder). Any attempt to save to other devices without using a file
name results in an error.
NOTE: Device 0 (the keyboard) and device 3 (the screen) cannot
be SAVEd to. If the attempt is made, an error will occur, and the
SAVE stopped.
  How to use:
  0) Use the SETLFS routine and the SETNAM routine (unless a
SAVE with no file name is desired on a save to the tape recorder).
  1) Load two consecutive locations on page with a pointer to
the start of your save (in standard 6502 low byte first, high byte next
format).
  2) Load the accumulator with the single byte page zero offset to
the pointer.
  3) Load the .X and .Y registers with the low byte and high byte
respectively of the location of the end of the save.

3           CRT display
4           Serial bus printer
8           CBM Serial bus disk drive

  Device numbers 4 or greater automatically refer to devices on the
serial bus.
  A command to the device is sent as a secondary address on the
serial bus after the device number is sent during the serial attention
handshaking sequence. If no secondary address is to be sent, the
.Y index register should be set to 255.
  How to use:
  1) Load the accumulator with the logical file number.
  2) Load the .X index register with the device number.
  3) Load the .Y index register with the command.

B-27. Function name: SETNAM
  Purpose: Set up file name
  Call address: $FFBD
  Communication registers: .A, .X, .Y
  Preparatory routines: None
  Stack requirements: None
  Registers affected: None
  Description: This routine is used to set up the file name for the
OPEN, SAVE, or LOAD routines. The accumulator must be loaded
with the length of the file name. The .X and .Y registers must be
loaded with the address of the file name, in standard 6502 low byte,
high byte format. The address can be any valid memory address in
the system where a string of characters for the file name is stored. If
no file name desired, the accumulator must be set to 0,
representing a zero file length. The .X and .Y registers may be set to
any memory address in that case.
  How to use:
  1) Load the accumulator with the length of the file name.
  2) Load the .X index register with the low order address of the
file name.
  3) Load the .Y index register with the high order address.

~
  Communication registers: .A, .X, .Y
  Preparatory routines: None
  Error returns: None
  Stack requirements: 2
  Registers affected: None
  Description: A system clock is maintained by an interrupt
routine that updates the clock every 1/60th of a second (one 'jiffy').
The clock is three bytes long, which gives the capability to count
up to 5,184,000 jiffies (24 hours). At that point the clock resets to
zero. Before calling this routine to set the clock, the accumulator
must contain the most significant byte, the .X index register the next
most significant byte, and the .Y index register the least significant
byte of the initial time setting (in jiffies).
  How to use:
  1) Load the accumulator with the MSB of the 3 byte number to
set the clock
  2) Load the .X register with the next byte.
  3) Load the .Y register with the LSB.
  4) Call this routine.

EXAMPLE:
  ; SET THE CLOCK TO 10 MINUTES = 3600 JIFFIES

B-29. Function name: SETTMO
  Purpose: Set serial bus timeout flag
  Call address: $FFA2
  Communication registers: .A
  Preparatory routines: None
  Error returns: None
  Stack requirements: 2
  Registers affected: None
  Description: This routine sets the timeout flag for the serial bus.
When the timeout flag is set, the VIC will wait for a device on the
serial port for 64 milliseconds. If the device does not respond to the
VIC's DAV signal within that time the VIC will recognize an error
condition and leave the handshake sequence. When this routine is
called when the accumulator contains a 0 in bit 7, timeouts are
enabled. A 1 in bit 7 will disable the timeouts. NOTE: The VIC uses
the timeout feature to communicate that a disk file is not found on an
attempt to OPEN a file.

                                    205
~
  How to use:
  TO SET THE TIMEOUT FLAG

  Purpose: Send a secondary address to a device commanded to
TALK
  Call address: $FF96
  Communication registers: .A
  Preparatory routines: TALK
  Error returns: See READST
  Stack requirements: None
  Registers affected: .A
  Description: This routine transmits a secondary address on the
serial bus for a TALK device. This routine must be called with a
number between 4 and 31 in the accumulator. The routine will send
this number as a secondary address command over the serial bus.
This routine can only be called after a call to the TALK routine. It will
not work after a LISTEN.
  How to use:
  0) Use the TALK routine.
  1) Load the accumulator with the secondary address.
  2) Call this routine.

EXAMPLE:
  ; TELL DEVICE #4 TO TALK WITH COMMAND #7

B-33. Function name: UDTIM
  Call address: $FFEA
  Purpose: Update the system clock
  Communication registers: None
  Preparatory routines: None
  Error returns: None
  Stack requirements: 2
  Registers affected: .A, .X
  Description: This routine updates the system clock. Normally
this routine is called by the normal KERNAL interrupt routine every
1/60th of a second. If the user program processes its own interrupts
this routine must be called to update the time. Also, the STOP key
routine must be called, if the stop key is to remain functional.
  How to use:
  1) Call this routine.

EXAMPLE:
  JSR UDTIM

B-34. Function name: UNLSN
  Purpose: Send an UNLISTEN command
  Call address: $FFAE
  Communication registers: None
  Preparatory routines: None
  Error returns: See READST
  Stack requirements: None
  Registers affected: .A
  Description: This routine commands all devices on the serial
bus to stop receiving data from the VIC (i.e., UNLISTEN). Calling
this routine results in an UNLISTEN command being transmitted on
the serial bus. Only devices previously commanded to listen will be
affected. This routine is normally used after the VIC is finished
sending data to external devices. Sending the UNLISTEN will
command the listening devices to get off the serial bus so it can be
used for other purposes.
  How to use:
  1) Call this routine.

EXAMPLE:
  JSR UNLSN

                                    208

B-35. Function name: UNTLK
  Purpose: Send an UNTALK command
  Call address: $FFAB
  Communication registers: None
  Preparatory routines: None
  Error returns: See READST
  Stack requirements: None
  Registers affected: .A
  Description: This routine will transmit an UNTALK command on
the serial bus. All devices previously set to TALK will stop sending
data when this command is received.
  How to use:
  1) Call this routine.

EXAMPLE:
  JSR UNTLK

B-36. Function name: VECTOR
  Purpose: Manage RAM vectors
  Call address: $FF8D
  Communication registers: .X, .Y
  Preparatory routines: None
  Error returns: None
  Stack requirements: 2
  Registers affected: .A, .X, .Y
  Description: This routine manages all system vector jump
addresses stored in RAM. Calling this routine with the accumulator
carry bit set will store the current contents of the RAM vectors in a
list pointed to by the .X and .Y registers. When this routine is called
with the carry bit clear, the user list pointed to by the .X and .Y registers
is transferred to the system RAM vectors. NOTE: This routine
requires caution in its use. The best way to use it is to first read the
entire vector contents into the user area, alter the desired vectors,
and then copy the contents back to the system vectors.
  How to use:
  READ THE SYSTEM RAM VECTORS
  1) Set the carry
  2) Set the .X and .Y registers to the address to put the vectors.
  3) Call this routine.

                                    209

  LOAD THE SYSTEM RAM VECTORS
  1) Clear the carry bit
  2) Set the .X and .Y registers to the address of the vector list in
RAM that must be loaded
  3) Call this routine.

EXAMPLE:
  CHANGE THE INPUT ROUTINES TO NEW SYSTEM
       LDX #<USER
       LDY #>USER
       SEC
       JSR VECTOR    ; read old vectors

ERROR CODES

  The following is a list of error messages which can occur when
using the KERNAL routines. If an error occurs during a KERNAL
routine, the carry bit of the accumulator is set, and the number of the
error message is returned in the accumulator.

 +--------+---------------------------------------+
 | NUMBER |             MEANING                   |
 +--------+---------------------------------------+
 |   0    |    Routine terminated by the STOP key |
 |   1    |    Too many open files                |
 |   2    |    File already open                  |
 |   3    |    File not open                      |
 |   4    |    File not found                     |
 |   5    |    Device not present                 |
 |   6    |    File is not an input file          |
 |   7    |    File is not an output file         |
 |   8    |    File name is missing               |

KERNAL POWER UP ACTIVITIES

1) KERNAL checks for the presence of ROM at $A000
  The KERNAL looks in memory at $A000 for the AUTO START
ROM SEQUENCE. If this sequence is present, control is
transferred to the ROM program.
  If this AUTO START ROM code is not present normal system
initialization continues.
2) RAM test
  The RAM TEST routine first clears memory from $0000-$00FF
and from $0200-$03FF. The cassette buffer pointer is initialized to
$033C.
  The RAM test starts at location $0400 and works upward,
checking for the first byte of RAM memory (start-of-RAM). If this
location is greater than $1000, then memory is considered bad and
an error screen is shown.
  Once the test has found the start of RAM it continues, checking
upward for the first non-RAM location (top-of-RAM). If this location
is <$2000, then memory is considered bad and an error screen is
shown.
  If top-of-RAM location is greater or equal to $2100, then the
screen is set to start at $1000, the bottom-of-memory is set to
$1200, and the top-of-memory is set to the top-of-RAM location.
  If the top-of-RAM location is less than $2100, then the screen is
set to start at $1E00, the bottom-of-memory is set to start-of-RAM,
and the top-of-memory is set to $1E00.
3) Other Activities
  I/O vectors are set to default values.
  The indirect jump table in low memory is established.
  The GETCHAR routine is created on page zero.
  The screen is then cleared, and the 'BYTES FREE' power up
message is displayed. Control of the system is turned over to
BASIC and the user.

  A: Interlace mode: A normal video frame is sent to the TV 60
times each second. Interlace mode cuts the number of repetitions
in half. When used with multiplexing equipment, this allows the VIC
picture to be blended with a picture from another source.
  To turn off: POKE 36864, PEEK(36864) AND 127
  To turn on:  POKE 36864, PEEK(36864) OR 128

  B: Screen origin - horizontal: This determines the positioning
of the image on the TV screen. The normal value is 5. Lowering the
value moves the screen to the left, and increasing it moves the
image to the right.
  To change value: POKE 36864, PEEK(36864) AND 128 OR X

  C: Screen origin - vertical: This determines the up-down
placement of the screen image. The normal value is 25. Lower-
ing this causes the screen to move up by 2 rows of dots for
each number lowered, and raising it moves the screen down.
  To change value: POKE 36865, X

  D: Number of video columns: Normally, this is set to 22.

                                    214
~
Changing this will change the display accordingly. Numbers over
27 will give a 27 column screen. The cursor controls are based on a
fixed number of 22 columns, and changing this number makes the
cursor controls misbehave.
  To change: POKE 36866, PEEK(36866) AND 128 OR X.

  E: Number of video rows: The number of rows may range from
0 to 23. A larger number of rows causes garbage to appear on the
bottom of the screen.
  To change: POKE 36867, PEEK(36867) AND 129 OR (X*2)

  F: Character size: This bit determined the size of the matrix
used for each character. A 0 here sets normal mode, in which
characters are 8 by 8 dots. A 1 sets 8 by 16 mode, where each
character is now twice as tall. 8 by 16 mode is normally used for
high resolution graphics, where it is likely to have many unique
characters on the screen.
  To set 8 by 8 mode: POKE 36867, PEEK(36867) AND 254
  To set 8 by 16 mode: POKE 36867, PEEK(36867) OR 1

  G: Raster value: This number is used to synchronize the light
pen with the TV picture.

  H: Screen memory location: This determines where in memory
the VIC keeps the image of the screen. The highest bit in location
36869 must be a 1. Bits 4-6 of location 36869 are bits 10-12 of the
screen's address, and bit 7 of location 36866 is bit 9 of the address
of the screen. To determine the location of the screen, use the
formula:
  S = 4*(PEEK(36866)AND 128) + 64*(PEEK(36869)AND
112)
Note that bit 7 of location 36866 also determines the location of
color memory. If this bit is a 0, color memory starts at location
37888. If this bit is a 0, color memory begins at 38400. Here is a
formula for this:
  C = 37888 + 4*(PEEK(36866)AND 128)

  I: Character memory location: This determines where
information on the shapes of characters are stored. Normally this
pointer is to the character generator ROM, which contains both the
upper case/graphics or the upper/lower case set. However, a
simple POKE command can change this pointer to a RAM location,
allowing custom character sets and high resolution graphics.
  To change: POKE 36869, PEEK(36869) AND 15 OR (X*16)
  (See chart on next page.)

  J: Light pen horizontal: This contains the latched number of the
dot under the light pen, from the left of the screen.

  K: Light pen vertical: The latched number of the dot under the
pen, counted from the top of the screen.

  R: Bass Frequency: This is a value corresponding to the
frequency of the tone being played. The larger the number, the
higher the pitch of the tone.
  The actual frequency of the sound in cycles per second (herz) is
determined by the following formula:

                       Clock
         Frequency = ---------
                      (127-X)

                                    216
~
  X is the number from 0 to 127 that is put into the frequency
register. If X is 127, then use -1 for X in the formula. The value of
Clock comes from the following table:

6522 VERSATILE INTERFACE ADAPTER

  The 6522 Versatile Interface Adapter (VIA) provides the VIC with
two peripheral ports with input latching, two powerful interval
timers, and a serial-to-parallel/parallel-to-serial shift register.
  Basically, the VIC chip handles Audio/Video input/output, and
the 6522 handles the rest...cassette operations, joysticks,
RS-232, and user port.

PORT B I/O REGISTER

  These eight bits are connected to the eight pins which make up
port B. Each pin can be set for either input or output.
  Input latching is available on this port. When latch mode is
enabled the data in the register freezes when the CB1 interrupt flag
is set. The register stays latched until the interrupt flag is cleared.
  Handshaking is available for output from this port. CB2 will act as
a DATA READY SIGNAL. This must be controlled by the user
program. CB1 acts as the DATA ACCEPTED signal, and must be
controlled by the device connected to the port. When DATA
ACCEPTED is sent to the 6522, the DATA READY line is cleared,
and the interrupt flag is set.

                                    218
~
PORT A I/O REGISTER

  These eight bits are connected to the eight pins which make up
port A. Each pin can be set for either input or output. Handshaking is
available for both read and write operations. Write handshaking is
similar to that on PORT B. Read handshaking is automatic. The
CA1 input pin acts as a DATA READY signal. The CA2 pin (used for
output) is used for a DATA ACCEPTED signal. When a DATA
READY signal is received a flag is set. The chip can be set to
generate an interrupt or the flag can be polled under program
control. The DATA ACCEPTED signal can either be a pulse or a DC
level. It is set low by the CPU and cleared by the DATA READY
signal.

DATA DIRECTION FOR PORT B

  This register is used to control whether a particular bit in PORT B
is used for input or output. Each bit of the data direction register
(DDR) is associated with a bit of port B. If a bit in the DDR is set to 1,
the corresponding bit of the port will be an OUTPUT. If a bit in the
DDR is 0, the corresponding bit of the port will be an INPUT.
  For example, if the DDR is set to 7, port B will be set up as follows:

       BITS NUMBER     DDR     PORT B FUNCTION
            0           1         OUTPUT
            1           1         OUTPUT
            2           1         OUTPUT
            3           0         INPUT
            4           0         INPUT
            5           0         INPUT
            6           0         INPUT
            7           0         INPUT

DATA DIRECTION REGISTER FOR PORT A

  This is similar to the DDR for port B, except that it works on PORT
A.

E,F,G,H: TIMER CONTROLS

  There are two timers on the 6522 chip. The timers can be set to
count down automatically or count pulses received by the VIA. The
mode of operation is selected by the Auxiliary Control Register.
  TIMER T1 on the 6522 consists of two 8-bit latches and a 16-bit
counter. The various modes of the TIMER are selected by setting
the AUXILIARY CONTROL REGISTER (ACR). The latches are

                                    219
~
used to store a 16-bit data word to load into the counter. Loading a
number into the latches does not affect the count in progress.
  After it is set, the counter will begin decrementing at 1 MHz. When
the counter reaches zero, an interrupt flag will be set, and the IRQ
will go low. Depending on how the TIMER is set, either further
interrupts will be disabled, or it will automatically load the two
latches into the counter and continue counting. The TIMER can
also be set to invert the output signal on a peripheral pin each time it
reaches zero and resets.
  The TIMER locations work differently on reading and writing.

WRITING TO THE TIMER

  E: Write into the low order latch. This latch can be loaded into the
low byte of the 16-bit counter.
  F: Write into the high order latch, write into the high order counter,
transfer low order latch into the low order counter, and reset the
TIMER T1 interrupt flag. In other words, when this location is set the
counter is loaded.
  G: Same as E.
  H: Write into the high order latch and reset the TIMER T1
interrupt flag.

READ TIMER T1

  E: Read the TIMER T1 low order counter and reset the TIMER
T1 interrupt flag.
  F: Read the TIMER T1 high order counter.
  G: Read the TIMER T1 low order latch.
  H: Read the TIMER T1 high order latch.

TIMER T2

  This TIMER operates as an interval timer (in one-shot mode), or
as a counter for counting negative pulses on PORT B pin 6. A bit in
the ACR selected which mode TIMER T2 is in.

WRITING TO TIMER T2

  I: Write TIMER T2 low order byte of latch.
  J: Write TIMER T2 high order counter byte, transfer low order
latch to low order counter, clear TIMER T2 interrupt flag.

READING TIMER T2

  I: Read TIMER T2 low order counter byte, and clear TIMER T2
interrupt flag.

                                    220
~
J: Read TIMER T2 high order counter byte.

K: SHIFT REGISTER

  A shift register is a register which will rotate itself through the CB2
pin. The shift register can be loaded with any 8-bit pattern which can
be shifted out through the CB1 pin, or input to the CB1 pin can be
shifted into the shift register and then read. This makes it highly
useful for serial to parallel and parallel to serial conversions.
  The shift register is controlled by bits 2-4 of the Auxiliary Control
Register.

L,M,N,O,P: AUXILIARY CONTROL REGISTER

L: TIMER 1 CONTROL 

  BIT  #   7   6
           0   0     One-shot mode (output to PB7 disabled)

           1   0     One-shot mode (output to PB7 enabled)
           1   1     Free running mode (output to PB7 enabled)

M: TIMER 2 CONTROL 

  TIMER 2 has 2 modes. If this bit is 0, TIMER 2 acts as an interval
timer in one-shot mode. If this bit is 1, TIMER 2 will count a
predetermined number of pulses on pin PB6.

~
O: PORT B LATCH ENABLE

  As long as this bit is 0, the PORT B register will directly reflect the
data on the pins.
  If this bit is set to one, the data present on the input pins of PORT
B will be latched within the chip when the CB1 INTERRUPT FLAG
is set. As long as the CB1 INTERRUPT FLAG is set, the data on the
pins can change without affecting the contents of the PORT B
register. Note that the CPU always reads the register (the latches)
rather than the pins.
  Input latching can be used with any of the input or output modes
available for CB2.

P: PORT A LATCH ENABLE

  As long as this bit is 0, the PORT A register will directly reflect the
data on the pins.
  If this bit is set to one, the data present on the input pins of PORT
A will be latched within the chip when the CA1 INTERRUPT FLAG
is set. As long as the CA1 INTERRUPT FLAG is set, the data on the
pins can change without affecting the contents of the PORT A
register. Note that the CPU always reads the register (the latches)
rather than the pins.
  Input latching can be used with any of the input or output modes
available for CA2.

T: CA1 CONTROL

  This bit of the PCR selects the active transition of the input signal
applied to the CA1 input pin. If this bit is 0, the CA1 interrupt flag (bit)
will be set on a negative transition (high-to-low) on the CA1 pin. If
this bit is a 1, the CA1 interrupt flag will be set on a positive transition
(low-to-high).
  There are two registers associated with interrupts: The
INTERRUPT FLAG REGISTER (IFR) and the INTERRUPT
ENABLE REGISTER (IER). The IFR has eight bits, each one
connected to a register in the 6522. Each bit in the IFR has an
associated bit in the IER. The flag is set when a register wants to
interrupt. However, no interrupt will take place unless the
corresponding bit in the IER is set.

UVWXYZab: INTERRUPT FLAG REGISTER

  When the flag is set, the pin associated with that flag is
attempting to interrupt the 6502. Bit U is not a normal flag. It goes
high if both the flag and the corresponding bit in the INTERRUPT
ENABLE REGISTER are set. It can be cleared only by clearing all
the flags in the IFR or disabling all active interrupts in the IER.

THE USER PORT

  The user port is meant to connect the VIC to the outside world. By
using the line available at this port, you can connect the VIC to a
printer, a Votrax Type and Talk, a MODEM, a second joystick, even
another computer.
  The port on the VIC is directly connected to one of the 6522 VIA
chips. By programming, the VIA will connect to many other devices.

F     PB3         locations. One is the PORT itself, and is
H     PB4         located at 37136 ($9110 HEX). Naturally you
J     PB5         PEEK it to read an INPUT, or POKE it to set
K     PB6         an OUTPUT. Each of the eight I/O lines can

  Each of the eight lines in the PORT has a BIT in the 8 bit DATA
DIRECTION REGISTER (DDR) which controls whether that line
will be an input or an output. If a bit in the DDR is a ONE, the
corresponding line of the PORT will be an OUTPUT. If a bit in the
DDR is ZERO, the corresponding line of the PORT will be an
INPUT. For example, if bit 3 of the DDR is set to 1, then line 3 of the
PORT will be an output. As another example, if the DDR is set like
this:
         BIT #:         7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
         VALUE:         0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0

You can see that lines 5,4, and 3 will be outputs since those bits are
ones. The rest of the lines will be inputs, since those lines are zeros.
  To PEEK of POKE the USER port, it is necessary to use both the
DDR and the PORT itself.
  Remember that the PEEK and POKE statements want a number
from 0-255. The numbers given in the example must be translated
into decimal before they could be used. (The value would be: 2^5 + 2^4
+ 2^3 = 32 + 16 + 8 = 56. See section 1 on numbers for more
details.)
  The other two lines, CB1 and CB2 are different from the rest of
the USER PORT. These two lines are mainly for HANDSHAKING,
and are programmed differently from port B.
  Handshaking is needed when two devices communicate. Since
one device may run at a different speed than another device, it is
necessary to give the devices some way of knowing what the other
is doing. Even when the devices are operating at the same speed,
handshaking is necessary to let the other know when data is to be
sent, and if it has been received. Both the CB1 and CB2 lines have
special characteristics which make them well suited for handshak-
ing.
  CB1 is usually used as an input (except under SHIFT REGISTER
control). CB2 can be used both for input and output, but is usually
used for output.
  It is not possible to read CB1 directly. CB1 is designed to set a
flag (bit 4) in the INTERRUPT FLAG register (located at 37149 or
$911D HEX) when a transition occurs on the CB1 line. Bit 4 of the
PERIPHERAL CONTROL REGISTER (PCR) located at 37148
($911C HEX) determines whether CB1 will set the flag on a

                                    230
~
low-to-high transition or on a high-to-low transition. Once the CB1
flag is set, it will stay set until you clear it by a PEEK or POKE to
PORT B which resets the CB1 flag bit. If bit 4 in the INTERRUPT
ENABLE register is set, and interrupts are enabled, the transition
will also cause an INTERRUPT REQUEST (IRQ).
  CB2 is controlled by the PCR. Bits 7,6 control whether CB2 will
be an input or an output. Bit 5 controls the setting of CB2.

BIT # 7 6 5    DESCRIPTION
      0 0 0    Interrupt Input Mode
      0 0 1    Independent Interrupt Input Mode
      0 1 0    Input Mode

      1 1 0    Manual Output Mode (CB2 is held LOW)
      1 1 1    Manual Output Mode (CB2 is held HIGH)

INTERRUPT INPUT MODE:

  The CB2 interrupt flag (IFR bit 3) will be set on a negative
(high-to-low) transition on the CB2 input line. The CB2 interrupt bit
will be cleared on a read or write to PORT B.

INDEPENDENT INTERRUPT INPUT MODE:

  As above, the CB2 interrupt flag will be set on a negative
transition on the CB2 input line. However, reading or writing to
PORT B does not clear the flag.

INPUT MODE:

  The CB2 interrupt flag (IFR bit 3) will be set on a positive
(low-to-high) transition of the CB2 line. The CB2 flag will be cleared
on a read or write of PORT B.

INDEPENDENT INPUT MODE:

  As above, the CB2 interrupt flag will be set on a positive transition
on the CB2 line. However, reading or writing PORT B does not
affect the flag.

HANDSHAKE OUTPUT MODE:

  The CB2 line will be set low on a write to PORT B. It will be reset
high again when there is an active transition on the CB1 line.

                                    231
~
PULSE OUTPUT MODE:
  The CB2 line is set low for one cycle after a write to PORT B.

MANUAL OUTPUT MODE:
  The CB2 line is held low.

MANUAL OUTPUT MODE:
  The CB2 line is held high.

MORE MUSIC FOR THE VIC

  Now that you know about the USER PORT, there is a little surprise
left. Up to now, the VIC has had 4 musical voices...three music
registers and a white noise register. By connecting a small amplifier
and speaker to the USER PORT, and doing a little programming,
you can get another musical voice.

THEORY

  Most music is made up of square waves of different amplitudes
and frequencies. One of the functions of the 6522 chip is to
generate square waves through the CB2 line. If we connect the
CB2 line to a speaker, we will be able to hear the square waves
generated by the VIC.

NOTE: Connecting a speaker directly to CB2 may damage your
VIC. You must connect the speaker through an amplifier to protect
the VIC.

PARTS NEEDED

1. Small battery powered speaker/amplifier
2. User Port Connector (12 position, 24 contact edge connector
with .156" spacing
3. Wire

CONNECTING TO YOUR VIC

1. Wire the GROUND of the amplifier to the GROUND of the USER
PORT (pin N).
2. Wire the SIGNAL of the amplifier to the CB2 output of the USER
PORT (pin M).
  You are now ready to add your other voice through a BASIC
program.

                                    232

BASIC PROGRAM STEPS:

  1. Set the 6522 shift register to free running mode by:
  POKE 37147,16
  2. Set the shift rate by:
  POKE 37144,C where C is an integer from 0 to 255
               C in the note to be played.
  3. Load the shift register by:
  POKE 37146,D where D = 15,51, or 85 for a square wave.
               This step sets the octave for the note.

  This step must be done last, since as soon as it is set, the VIC
starts generating the square waves.
  The frequency of the square wave can be found by the following
formula:
              500000 Hz
  FREQUENCY = ---------    Where D1 = 8 when D = 15
              (C+2)(D1)          D1 = 4 when D = 51
                                 D1 = 2 when D = 85

  When you are in this mode, the VIC will not read or write to
cassette. To restore normal operations, you must:
  POKE 37147,0

  The following program demonstrates music using this method.
By hitting a letter the note will be played.

THE SERIAL BUS
  The serial bus is a daisy chain arrangement designed to let the
VIC communicate with the VIC-1540 DISK DRIVE and the
VIC-1515 GRAPHICS PRINTER. Up to 5 devices can be
connected to the serial bus at one time.
  All devices connected on the serial bus will receive all the data
transmitted over the bus. To allow the VIC to route data to its
intendent destination, each device has a bus ADDRESS. By using
this device address, the VIC can control access to the bus.
Addresses on the serial bus range from 4 to 31.
  The VIC can COMMAND a particular device to TALK or LISTEN.
When the VIC commands a device to TALK, the device will begin
putting data onto the serial bus. When VIC commands a device to
LISTEN, the device addressed will get ready to receive data (from
the VIC or from another device on the bus). Only one device can
TALK on the bus at a time; otherwise the data will collide and the
system will crash in confusion. However, any number of devices
can LISTEN at the same time to one TALKER.

         COMMON SERIAL BUS ADDRESSES
Number      Device
4 or 5      VIC-1515 GRAPHIC PRINTER
8           VIC DISK DRIVE

  Other device addresses are possible. Each device is wired to an
address. Certain devices (like the VIC printer) provide a choice
between two addresses for the convenience of the user.
  The SECONDARY ADDRESS is to let the VIC transmit set up
information to a device. For example, to OPEN a connection on the
bus to the printer, and have it print in UPPER/LOWER case, use the
following:
  OPEN 1,4,7
  Where 1 is the logical file number (the number you PRINT# to)
        4 is the ADDRESS of the printer
    and 7 is the SECONDARY ADDRESS that tells the printer to
go into UPPER/LOWER case mode.

SERIAL SRQ IN: (SERIAL SERVICE REQUEST IN)

  Any device on the serial bus can bring this signal LOW when it
requires attention from the VIC. The VIC will then take care of the
device.

SERIAL ATN IN/OUT: (SERIAL ATTENTION IN/OUT)

  The VIC uses this signal to start a command sequence for a
device on the serial bus. When the VIC brings this signal LOW, all
other devices on the bus start listening for the VIC to transmit an
address. The device addressed must respond in a preset period of
time; otherwise the VIC will assume that the device addressed is
not on the bus, and will return an error in the STATUS WORD.

SERIAL CLK IN/OUT: (SERIAL CLOCK IN/OUT)

  This signal is used for timing on the serial bus.

SERIAL DATA IN/OUT:
  Data on the serial bus is transmitted one bit at a time on this line.

USING THE VIC GRAPHIC
PRINTER

  The VIC Graphic Printer connects to the serial port on the back of
the VIC and is used for printing out listings of programs, statistical
data, graphs, charts and even graphic plotting. The VIC printer can
also be used with the VICWriter wordprocessing cartridge to write
reports, transcribe school notes, write letters and other documents.
  Programmers use dot matrix printers to make paper copies of
program listings which are easier to debug and edit on paper. It's
also helpful to print out text and graphics displayed on the screen
through what is called a "screen dump on the printer."
  Several short programs which demonstrate the use of the printer
are included below. We've even included a special "typing"
program which lets you use the VIC as a typewriter to enter words
or graphics directly from the keyboard.

LISTING DATA ON YOUR VIC PRINTER

  The proper format for printing out a listing of a program which
resides in memory is to enter the following line and type RUN.
  OPEN4,4:CMD4:LIST
  Note that if you have left a printer file open you will get a FILE
OPEN error. If this happens, type CLOSE4, and hit RETURN. Then
retype the above.
  If you're developing a new program, you probably want to list out
each revision so you can edit it on paper before proceeding to the
next step. A good way to do this is to (1) type in your program, (2)
include an END statement at the end of the program, (3) include the
list-to-printer instruction at a high line number above the END
statement, and (4) RUN the line with the printer instruction
whenever you want to list out the program. This technique lets you
RUN and edit your program normally, but it saves you the trouble of
having to type the LIST line every time you want a listing on
paper. In the following example, if you type RUN, the program will
print out line 10. If you type RUN 5000, the program will list to the
printer.
  10 PRINT "THIS IS MY PROGRAM"
  20 END
  5000 CLOSE4:OPEN4,4:CMD4:LIST

                                    236

VIC GRAPHIC PRINTER COMMAND CHART
  The VIC Graphic Printer includes a strong "language" of special
print commands, as described in the following chart. Insert the
CHR$ command to use these commands:
  10 PRINT#4,CHR$(14)"PUT DATA HERE".

 +-----------------+-----------------------------------------------+

PRINTING DOT PROGRAMMABLE GRAPHICS

  There are two fairly easy ways to print your own graphic
characters - in other words, "dot programmable graphics." One
way is to purchase Commodore's PROGRAMMABLE CHARAC-
TER SET & GAMEGRAPHICS EDITOR, which is available on tape
at an economical price. The other way is to define your own
characters TO THE PRINTER using a character matrix of 7x7
dots. You have to define each character in terms of its binary code
and the best way to do this is to use DATA statements. Look at the
following matrix and decide which dot pattern you would like to
design. A sample is shown. Now, to print this out, you have to add
up the binary values for each column. Count zero for empty blocks,
count the value shown on the left of the pattern if there is a dot there,
then add up all the values for the column. The total of each column
is shown at the bottom in our sample on page 238.

                                    237
~
PRINTING IN DIRECT MODE

  You can use your printer like a typewriter by printing in the DIRECT
MODE. In this mode, the printer prints everything between the
quotation marks including graphics and reversed characters.
Here's a sample of how it's done:

SAMPLE PROGRAM

   |-------------7-------------|      10 DATA156,162,193,193,182,162

                  READY.

PRINTING DOUBLE WIDTH CHARACTERS

  Double width characters have many applications, from enlarging
graphics on paper to printing bold face headlines and titles. The
following program demonstrates how to use CHR$(14) to print
double spaced letter...and also shows how to get back to normal
letters by typing CHR$(15).

  10 OPEN4,4:PRINT#4,CHR$(14)"DOUBLE LETTERS"
  20 PRINT#4,"STILL DOUBLE"

                                    238
~
  30 PRINT#4,CHR$(15)"NORMAL AGAIN"
  40 PRINT"HELLO AGAIN IN NORMAL MODE"

(If you change PRINT#4 to CMD4 in line 30 it still works.)

PRINTING REVERSE CHARACTERS

  You may use the codes shown in the VIC Graphic Printer
Command chart to tell the printer to print reverse characters by
including these lines:
  Reverse On: 10 OPEN4,4:PRINT#4,CHR$(18)
  Print Info: 20 PRINT#4,"VIC 20"
  Reverse Off: 30 PRINT#4,CHR$(146)
  Normal Again: 40 PRINT#4,"VIC 20"

PRINTING WHAT IS DISPLAYED ON THE SCREEN

  Type and run these lines as a program or as a subroutine to get a
printout of what is displayed on the screen from your program.
When you use it, add a line or command that says: GOSUB 60000
and enter this program as shown. Lines 10 through 25 are included
to give you an example of how this can work and are not part of the
screen dump program. Your own program would have different
commands here, of course.
  You can type different "screens" of information in the course of a
program. One way to do this is to add a line in your program that
would scan the keyboard and look for a function key. Try adding this
line as the first line: 10 GETX$:IFX$=CHR$(133)
THEN GOSUB60000. This line lets you print out whatever is on the
screen whenever you hit Function Key 1.

  10 PRINT"SAMPLE"

PRINTING VIC PROGRAMS

  Many VIC programs work with the VIC Graphic Printer. Our
Home Calculation programs, for example, let you hit a function key
to print out a screen full of data for your records and files. This is
helpful in keeping paper records of home inventory lists, personal
budget information, etc. These programs give you the ability to
compile, calculate, edit and delete information on your VIC 20, then
print out the results. A powerful combination!

VIC EXPANSION PORT

THE EXPANSION CONNECTOR

  The expansion connector is a 48 pin (24/24) female edge
connector on the back of the VIC. With the VIC facing you, the
expansion connector is on the far right of the back. To use the
connector, a 44 pin (22/22) male edge connector is required.
  The expansion bus is arranged as follows:

    1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22

  This port is used for expansion of the VIC system which require
access to the address bus or the data bus of the computer. Caution
is necessary when using the expansion bus, as it is possible to
damage the VIC by malfunctioning user equipment.

RAM Signals - RAM 1,2, and 3 are active low signals which are
used to decode memory placed in the 3K block from $0400 to
$1000. Each of the RAM signals controls a 1K block of memory.
When a RAM signal goes low, it indicates that the block of memory
it controls is being addressed.
___
BLK Signals - The four block signals are also for memory
expansion of the system. In this case, however, each decodes a
different 8K block of memory. As with the /RAM signals, each is
active low. Blocks 1,2, and 3 can be used for either RAM or ROM.
Memory in those locations can (and will) be used by BASIC.
Memory in Block 5, however, should be ROM, as this area is not
accessible to BASIC. If RAM is placed here it can only be utilized by
machine language programs.
  IMPORTANT NOTE: If the additional memory is added to the VIC
using the /BLOCK decoding signals, memory added by using the
/RAM signals can not be used by BASIC for storage of BASIC text.
This is because BASIC demands a continuous area for programs.
With additional memory in the /BLOCK decoded areas, the screen
moves to $1000, breaking up the area. Memory placed in those
/RAM areas can still be used by machine language programs.
___
IRQ - This is the interrupt request line. The VIC uses this internally
for keyboard scan and the system clock.
_____
RESET - When this line is grounded, it causes a COLD START of
the VIC. Everything is RESET, including memory, so any program
in the VIC at that time is destroyed.

                                    243
~
___
NMI - When this line is grounded, it causes a VIC WARM START
(just like RUN/STOP-RESTORE).

Address Bus - The address bus controls what memory location or
I/O device the VIC will read from or write to. Only 14 bits appear on
the connector, even though the address bus size is 16 bits,
because two bits are decoded into the BLOCK and I/O signals.

Data Bus - The data bus is used by the VIC to move data to or from
memory or I/O devices.
___
I/O Signals - These two signals can be used to add additional I/O
devices to the VIC. The IEEE adapter from Commodore uses these
signals.

Read/Write Signals - These signals inform the memory or the
device being addressed whether the VIC wants to write data or read
data. If the signal is high, a read is expected. If the signal is low, a
write is desired.
  There are two R/W signals available on the expansion port. One
(CR/W) is connected to the 6502. The other (VR/W) is connected to
the VIC chip. Memory expansion will normally use the VR/W signal.
Other devices may need the CR/W signal.

WHAT HAPPENS WHEN MEMORY IS
EXPANDED

  The VIC comes with 5K of random access memory (RAM)
located from 0 to 1023 ($0000 to $03FF) for operating system use,
4096-8192 ($1000 to $1FFF) which is BASIC program area, and
from 38400 to 38911 ($9600 to $97FF) which is COLOR memory
area.
  When additional memory is added the VIC screen location, color
memory location, or the start of BASIC might change.

Start of      Start of     Start of      Start of
Added memory  Screen       Color Memory  BASIC
1024-4095     7680 ($1E00) 38400 ($9600) 1024 ($0400)
8192 on up    4096 ($1000) 37888 ($9400) 4608 ($1200)
($2000-3FFF)
($4000-5FFF)
($6000-7FFF)

  The VIC has 2 areas to add additional memory - a 3K space from
1024 to 4095 ($0400 to $0FFF) and a 24K section from 8192 to

                                    244
~
32767 ($2000 to $7FFF). When the large expansion area is used,
BASIC cannot use the 3K area as program area.
  When memory is added in the 3K area, the BASIC program area
will start at the beginning of the new RAM area. The screen will still
begin at 7680 and color memory will still begin at 38400. However,
the start of BASIC will be at 1024.
  The VIC chip cannot access any of this new memory, so screen
memory and programmable character memory must be in VIC
internal memory (4096 to 8191).
  Memory is added to the larger expansion area in 8K blocks,
beginning at 8192 ($2000). BASIC demands a continuous block area for
programs. This is why the screen is moved - otherwise, the video
screen will be in the middle of your program. The same reason
prevents the 3K RAM area from being used by BASIC when
additional memory is added to the large expansion area. However,
machine language programs can still use this area though.
  The start of BASIC will begin at 4608 ($1200), the video screen
will start at 4096 ($1000) and color memory will start at 37888
($9400).
  See Section 3 for the formulas to use to calculate the screen start
address. If you want your programs to work on any VIC memory
configuration, your program must use these formulas in POKEs
and PEEKs to the screen. The best way to use this is at the
beginning, set a variable to the start of screen memory and one to
the start of color memory. Then, do any POKEs or PEEKs to the
screen relative to those variables. (Example: if C is the start of the
screen, to put an 'A' on the first line on the 10th column of the
screen, type: POKEC+10,1.)

GAME CONTROLLERS

USING A JOYSTICK ON THE VIC

  Like all other input and output, the joysticks are controlled using
the VIC'S 6522 Versatile Interface Adapters (VIAs). The 6522 is a
very versatile and complex device. Fortunately, it isn't necessary to
delve deeply into the mysteries of the 6522 VIA to read the
joysticks.
  Each 6522 has two Input/Output ports, called port A and port B.
Each of the ports has a control register attached, called the DATA
DIRECTION REGISTER (DDR). This highly important register
controls the direction of the port. By using this register you can use
the port for input, output, or both at the same time. To set one bit of
the port to output, set the corresponding bit of the Data Direction
Register to 1. To set a bit of the port for input, set the corresponding
bit of the DDR to 0. For example, to set bit 7 of port A to input, and
the rest of the bits to output, poke 127 in the DDR for port A.
  To read the joystick, one port (and one DDR) of each of the 6522
VIAs on the VIC must be used.
  The joystick switches are arranged as follows:

                                TOP
         FIRE BUTTON
         Switch 4 (FR)    
                              Switch 0
                                (S0)
                                 |
                                 |
                                 |
                  Switch 2 ------ ------ Switch 3
                    (S2)         |         (S3)
                                 |
                                 |
                                (S1)
                              Switch 1

  Switch 0, Switch 1, Switch 2, and the Fire button can be read from
VIA #1, which is located beginning at location $9110. Switch 3
must be read from the other 6522 (VIA #2) which is located
beginning at location $9120.

                                    246
~
  Now the key locations for the joystick are as follows:

HEX     DECIMAL    PURPOSE
$9113   37139      Data direction register for I/O port A on VIA #1

$9111   37137      Output register A
                   Bit 2 Joy switch 0
                   Bit 3 Joy switch 1
                   Bit 4 Joy switch 2
                   Bit 5 Fire Button

$9122   37154      Data direction register for I/O port B on VIA #2

$9120   37152      Output register B
                   Bit 7 Joy switch 3

  To read the joystick inputs, you first set the ports to input mode by
setting the DDR to 0. This can be done by a POKE. Then the value
of the switches can be read by two peeks. Sounds easy, right?
There is only one problem...VIC #2 is also used for reading the
keyboard. Setting the DDR can mess up the keyscan rather badly.
So you have to make sure you restore the DDR to the original
condition if you want to use the keyboard afterwards.
  To make things really easy, you can use the following program.
Lines 10 to 25 are initialization. The rest of the program, beginning
at line 9000, can be called as a subroutine whenever you want to
read the joystick.

  10 DIM JS(2,2):POKE37139,0:DD=37154:PA=37137:
   PB=37152
  20 FORI=0TO2:FORJ=0TO2:READJS(J,I):NEXTJ,I
  25 DATA-23,-22,-21,-1,0,1,21,22,23
  30 GOSUB9000:PRINTJS(X+1,Y+1):GOTO30
  9000 POKEDD,127:S3=-((PEEK(PB)AND128)=0):
   POKEDD,255
  9010 P=PEEK(PA):S1=-((PAND8)=0):S2=((PAND16)=0)
   :S0=((PAND4)=0)
  9020 FR=-((PAND32)=0):X=S2+S3:Y=S0+S1:RETURN

  The variables S0,S1,S2, and S3 will be 0 normally, and will be
set to 1 (or -1) when the joystick is pointed in that direction. Two of

                                    247
~
the variables will be set to 1 on diagonal. FR will be 1 when
the firing button is pressed, 0 otherwise.
  The AND function is used to pick out one bit of the joystick port.
The bits are numbered from 7 (most significant bit) to 0 (least
significant bit). By ANDing the 6522 port with a number whose
value is a power of two, a single bit is selected. (For example, to pick
bit 3, AND using 2^3 or 8).
  The JS array in the program is set up to make moving around the
screen using the joystick easy. The numbers in the DATA
statement of line 25 can easily be changed for other purposes. For
example...
  To "decode" the joystick in this pattern:

                     TOP
         FIRE
                      0
                    7 | 1
                  6 - 8 - 2
                    5 | 3
                      4

  The data statement should be changed to:
  25 DATA7,0,1,6,8,2,5,4,3

USING PADDLES ON THE VIC

  The paddles are read using both the VIC chip and the VIC's 6522
Versatile Interface Adapters (VIAs).
  The values of the paddles are read through the VIC chip. There
are two registers, one for each paddle, which will contain the
current value of the paddle. This data will be in digitized form, as a
value from 0 to 255.
  The switches on each paddle are read from the VIA chips. Each
VIA has two INPUT/OUTPUT ports, called PORT A and PORT B.
Each of the ports has a control register attached, called the DATA
DIRECTION REGISTER (DDR). This register controls the direction
of the port. By using this register you can use the port for input,
output, or both at the same time. To set one bit of the port to output,
set the corresponding bit of the Data Direction Register to 1. To set
a bit of the port for input, set the corresponding bit of the DDR to 0.
For example, to set bit 7 of port A to input, and the rest of the bits to
output, poke 127 in the DDR for port A.
  To read the paddle switches, one port (and one DDR) of each of
the 6522 VIAs on the VIC must be used.

                                    248
~
  The joystick switches are arranged as follows:
                  Paddle X --- --- Paddle Y
                    (S2)             (S3)

  Switch 2 can be read from VIA #1, which is located beginning at
location $9110. Switch 3 must be read from the other 6522 (VIA #2)
which is located beginning at location $9120.
  Now, the key locations for the paddle are as follows:

  HEX    DECIMAL     PURPOSE
  9008   36872       Digitized value of PADDLE X
  9009   36873       Digitized value of PADDLE Y
  9113   37139       Data direction register for I/O port A on
                     VIA #1
  9111   37137       Output register A
                     Bit 4 PADDLE SWITCH X
  9122   37154       Data direction register for I/O port B on
                     VIA #2
  9120   37152       Output register B
                     Bit 7 PADDLE SWITCH Y

  To read the paddle inputs, you first set the ports to input mode by
setting the DDR to 0. This can be done by a POKE. Then the value
of the switches can be read by two peeks. Sounds easy, right?
There is only one problem...VIA #2 is also used for reading the
keyboard. Setting the DDR can mess up the kayscan rather badly.
So you have to make sure you restore the DDR to the original
condition if you want to use the keyboard afterwards.
  To make things really easy, you can use the following program.
Lines 10 to 25 are initialization. The rest of the program, beginning
at line 9000, can be called as a subroutine whenever you want to
read the paddle.

  10 POKE37139,0:DD=37154:PA=37137:PB=37152
  20 PX=36872:PY=36873
  30 GOSUB9000:PRINTPEEK(PX);PEEK(PY);X;Y:GOTO30
  9000 POKEDD,127:Y=-((PEEK(PB)AND128)=0):POKEDD,255
  9010 X=-((PEEK(PA)AND16)=0):RETURN

  The variables X and Y will be 0 normally, and will be set to 1 when
that paddle button is pressed.

                                    249
~
  The AND function is used to pick out one bit of the paddle port.
The bits are numbered from 7 (most significant bit) to 0 (least
significant bit). By ANDing the 6522 port with a number whose
value is a power of two, a single bit is selected. (For example, to pick
bit 3, AND using 8.)

USING A LIGHT PEN ON THE VIC

  One of the benefits of using the VIC chip as the controller for the
VIC 20 is that it is easy to add certain input/output devices for
games and educational software. It is as easy to add a light pen as it
is to add game paddles and joysticks.
  The principle behind the light pen is simple. Basically, the pen is a
light detector, set to detect either the presence or absence of light.
The television picture is not put on the screen all at once - rather, it
is put on the screen one row at a time, scanning from left to right
very quickly.
  When the scan passes the area where the pen is, a signal is sent
to the VIC chip. When this signal is received, the VIC chip, which
keeps track of where the scan line is at any particular moment, will
record the exact location of the scan in two registers, 36870 (9006
HEX) for the X direction and 36871 (9007) in the Y direction. You
can read and use this information in your programs.
  The light pen trigger is connected to pin 6 of the game port. The
light pen trigger input can also be reached from pin 7 of the user
port. Note that you can't use a joystick and a light pen at the same
time, because the same line that is used as the light pen trigger
input is used as the joystick fire button input (you would get false
readings).
  The VIC chip constantly keeps track of the scan position on the
television in two registers. When the light pen trigger input is
brought low, the VIC freezes the two registers. You can then read
and use this information. After reading the two registers, the trigger
line will be cleared, so that scan information can be placed again in
the two registers.

                                    250

RS-232 INTERFACE
DESCRIPTION - BUILT-IN SOFTWARE

GENERAL OUTLINE

  The VIC has a built-in RS-232 interface for connection to any
RS-232 mode, printer, or other device. To connect the device to
the VIC a cable is required, as well as some programming.
  RS-232 on the VIC is standard RS-232 format, but the voltages
are TTL levels (0 to 5V) rather than the normal RS-232 -12 to 12 volt
range. The cable between the VIC and the RS-232 device should
take care of the voltage conversion needed. The Commodore VIC
RS-232 interface cartridge handles this properly.
  The RS-232 interface software can be accessed from BASIC or
from the KERNAL for machine language programming. RS-232 on
the BASIC level uses the normal BASIC commands: OPEN,
CLOSE, CMD, INPUT#, GET#, PRINT#, and the reserved
variable ST. INPUT# (CHRIN for the machine language program-
mers in the audience) and GET# (GETIN) fetch data from the
receiving buffer, while PRINT# (CHROUT) and CMD place data into
the transmitting buffer. The use of these commands (and
examples) will be described more fully later.
  The RS-232 KERNAL byte/bit level handlers run under the
control of the 6522 device timers and interrupts. The 6522
generates NMI requests for RS-232 processing. This allows
background RS-232 processing to take place during BASIC and
machine language programs. There are built-in hold-offs in the
KERNAL cassette and serial bus routines to prevent disruption of
data storage/transmission by the NMI's generated by the RS-232
routines. During cassette or serial bus activities data cannot be
received from RS-232 devices. Because these hold-offs are only
local (assuming case is taken in programming) no interference
should result.
  There are two buffers in the VIC RS-232 interface to help prevent
loss of data when transmitting of receiving RS-232. The VIC 20
RS-232 KERNAL buffers consist of two first-in/first-out (FIFO)
buffers, each 256 bytes long, at the top of memory. The OPENing of
an RS-232 channel automatically allocates 512 bytes of memory
for these buffers. If there is not enough free space beyond the end
of your BASIC program no error message will be printed, and the
end of your program will be destroyed. SO BE CAREFUL!
  These buffers are automatically removed by the CLOSE
command.

                                    251
~
OPENING AN RS-232 CHANNEL

  Only one RS-232 channel should be open at any time; a second
OPEN statement will cause the buffer pointers to be reset. Any
characters in either the transmit buffer or the received buffer will be
lost.
  Up to 4 characters may be sent in the filename field. The first two
are the control and command register characters; the other two are
reserved for future system options. Baud rate, parity, and other
options can be selected through this feature.
  No error-checking is done on the control word to detect a
nonimplemented baud rate, so that any illegal control word will
cause the system output to operate at a very slow rate (below 50
baud).

BASIC SYNTAX
  OPEN lf,2,0,"<control register><command register>"
  lf - Normal logical file id (1-255). If lf>127 than linefeed follows
carriage return.

 | IMPORTANT: In a BASIC program, the RS-232 OPEN com-             |
 | mand should be performed before using any variable or DIM       |
 | statement, since an automatic CLR is performed when an          |
 | RS-232 channel is OPENed (because of the allocation of 512      |
 | bytes at the top of memory.) Also remember that your program    |
 | will be destroyed if 512 bytes of space is not available at the |
 | time of the OPEN statement.                                     |

GETTING DATA FROM RS-232 CHANNEL

  When getting data, the VIC receiver buffer will hold 255
characters before a buffer overflow. This is indicated in the RS-232
status word (ST from BASIC, rsstat from machine language). If this
occurs, all characters received during a full buffer condition are lost.
Obviously it pays to keep the buffer as clear as possible.

                                    252

  If you wish to receive RS-232 data at high speeds (BASIC can
only go so fast, especially considering garbage collects. This can
cause the receive buffer to overflow), you will have to use machine
language routines to handle the data bursts.

 |   If the word length is less than 8 bits, all unused bit(s) will be   |
 | assigned a value of zero.                                             |

 | null) is returned.                                                    |
 |   If INPUT# is used, then the system will hang until a non-null       |
 | character and a following carriage return is received. Thus, if the   |
 | CTS or DSR line(s) disappear during character INPUT#, the             |

SENDING DATA TO AN RS-232 CHANNEL

  When sending data, the output buffer can hold 256 characters
before a full buffer hold-off occurs. The system will wait in the
CHROUT routine until transmission is allowed or the RUN/STOP-
RESTORE keys are used to recover the system through a WARM
START.

 | IMPORTANT: There is no carriage-return delay built into the output      |
 | channel so a normal RS-232 printer cannot correctly print, unless       |
 | some form of hold-off (asking the VIC to wait) or internal buffering is |
 | implemented by the printer. The hold-off can easily be implemented      |
 | in your program. If a CTS (x-line) handshake is implemented, the        |
 | VIC buffer will fill and hold off more output until transmission is     |
 | allowed by the RS-232 device.                                           |
 |   The routine CHKOUT handles the x-line handshake, which                |

CLOSING AN RS-232 DATA CHANNEL

  Closing an RS-232 file discards all data in the buffers at the time
of execution (whether or not it had been transmitted or printed out),
stop all RS-232 transmitting and receiving, sets the RTS and Sout
lines high, and removes both RS-232 buffers.

  $00F9-ROBUF A two byte pointer to the Transmitter Buffer base
location.
  The two locations above are set up by the KERNAL OPEN
routine, each pointing to a different 256 byte buffer. They are
de-allocated by writing a zero into the high order bytes, ($00F8 and
$00FA), which is done by the KERNAL CLOSE entry. They may
also be allocated/de-allocated by the machine language program-
mer for his/her own purposes, removing/creating only the buffer(s)
required. Both the OPEN and CLOSE routines will not notice that
their jobs might have been done already. When using a machine
language program that allocates these buffers, care must be taken
to make sure that the top of memory pointers stay correct,
especially if BASIC programs are expected to run at the same time.

APPENDIX A

ABBREVIATIONS FOR BASIC KEYWORDS

  As a time saver when typing in programs and commands, VIC BASIC
allows the user to abbreviate most keywords. The abbreviation for the word
PRINT is a question mark. The abbreviation for the other words are made
by typing the first one or two letters of the keyword, followed by the
SHIFTed next letter of the word. If the abbreviations are used in a program
line, the keyword will LIST in the longer form. Note that some of the
keywords when abbreviated include the first parenthesis, and some do
not.

COLOR CODE TABLE

  Following are the various colors the VIC can display...note
that colors 8-15 can only be used as a SCREEN COLOR or an
AUXILIARY COLOR (see pg. 93 for explanation of auxiliary
colors used in MULTICOLOR MODE). As an example, these
color numbers are used to POKE a color into "color mem-
ory" when coloring characters POKEd to the screen. If you
POKE7680,81 this places a "ball" on the screen but it will be
"invisible" until you add the color by typing POKE38400,0
(BLACK). Try POKE38400,2 for RED, etc. (Numbers 8-15 can-
not be used as character colors)

SCREEN & BORDER COLOR
COMBINATIONS

  You can change the screen and border colors of the VIC anytime, in or
out of a program, by typing
                     POKE 36879,X
where X is one of the numbers shown in the chart below. POKE 36879,27
returns the screen to the normal color combinations, which is a CYAN
border and white screen.
  Try typing POKE 36879,8. Then type CTRL{white} and you have
white letters on a totally black screen! Try some other combinations. This
POKE command is a quick and easy way to change the screen colors in a
program.

APPENDIX D

SCREEN DISPLAY CODES

  The following chart lists all of the characters built-in to the VIC 20
character sets. It shows which numbers should be POKEd into the screen
memory (locations 7680 to 8185) to get a desired character. Also, it shows
what character corresponds to a number PEEKed from the screen.
  The two character sets are available, but only one at a time. This
means that you cannot have characters from one set on the screen at the
same time you have characters from the other set displayed. The sets are
switched by holding down the SHIFT and COMMODORE keys
simultaneously. This actually changes the 2nd bit in memory location 36869,
which means that the statement POKE 36869,240 will set the character
set to upper case, and POKE 36869,242 switches to lower case.
  If you want to do some serious animation, you will find that it is easier to
control objects on the screen by POKEing them into screen memory (and
erasing them by POKEing a 32, which is the code for a blank space, into the
same memory location), then by PRINTing to the screen by using cursor
control characters.
  Any number shown on the chart may also be displayed in REVERSE.
Reverse characters are not shown, but the reverse of any character may
be obtained by adding 128 to the numbers shown.

  NOTE: SEE SCREEN MEMORY MAP APPENDIX E

  If you want to display a heart at screen location 7800, find the number of
the character you want to display there (in this case a heart) in this chart...
the number for the heart is 83...then type in a POKE statement with the
numbers of the screen location (7800) and the number of the symbol (83)
like this:
                  POKE 7800,83
  A white heart should appear in the middle area of the screen. Note that it
will be invisible if the screen is white. Try changing the position by chang-
ing the larger number, or type in different symbols using the numbers from
the chart.

  If you want to change the COLOR of the symbol being displayed, consult
the Color Codes Memory Map in Appendix E which lists the COLOR
NUMBERS for EACH MEMORY LOCATION. In other words, to get a
different colored symbol at a particular location, this requires another
POKE command.

                                    267
~
  For example, to get a red heart, type the following:
                        POKE 38520,2
                                    \
                                     +---------------------+
                                     | In screen pokes     |
                                     | this color is       |
                                     | one less than       |
                                     | the numbers on the  |
                                     | keyboard color keys |
                                     +---------------------+

  This changes the color of the symbol at location 7800 to red. If you had a
different symbol there, that symbol would now be red. You can display any
character in any of the available colors by combining these two charts.
These POKE commands can be added in your programs and are very
effective especially in animation - and also provide a means to PEEK at
certain locations if you are doing sophisticated programming such as
bouncing a ball, which requires this information.

APPENDIX E

SCREEN MEMORY MAPS

  Use this appendix to find the memory location of any position on the
screen. Just find the position in the grid and add the numbers on the row
and column together. For example, if you want to poke the graphic "ball"
character onto the center of the screen, add the numbers at the edge of row
11 and column 11 (7900 + 10) for a total of 7910. If you poke the code for a
ball (81, see Appendix D) into location 7910 by typing POKE 7910,81, a
white ball appears on the screen. To change the color of the ball (or other
character), find the corresponding position on the color codes memory
map, add the row and column numbers together (38620 + 10, or 38630) for
the color code and type a second poke statement. For example, if you poke
a color code into this location, POKE 38630,3 the ball will change color to
cyan. Note that when POKEing, the character color numbers are one less
than the numbers on the color keys - as shown below.

  Abbreviated List of Color Codes:
                     Code     Color
                      0       Black
                      1       White
                      2       Red
                      3       Cyan
                      4       Purple
                      5       Green

                      7       Yellow

APPENDIX F

ASCII AND CHR$ CODES

  This appendix shows you what characters will appear if you PRINT
CHR$(X), for all possible values of X. It will also show the values obtained
by typing PRINT ASC("x") where x is any character you can type. This is
useful in evaluating the character received in a GET statement, converting
upper/lower case, and printing character-based commands (like switch to
upper/lower case) that could not be enclosed in quotes.

APPENDIX H

ERROR MESSAGES

  This appendix contains a complete list of the error messages generated
by the VIC, with a description of the causes.

BAD DATA  String data was received from an open file, but the program
was expecting numeric data.

BAD SUBSCRIPT  The program was trying to reference an element of an
array whose number is outside of the range specified in the DIM statement.

CAN'T CONTINUE  The CONT command will not work, either because
the program was never RUN, there has been an error, or a line has been
edited.

DEVICE NOT PRESENT  The required I/O device was not available for
an OPEN, CLOSE, CMD, PRINT#, INPUT#, or GET#.

DIVISION BY ZERO  Division by zero is a mathematical oddity and not
allowed.

EXTRA IGNORED  Too many items of data were typed in response to an
INPUT statement. Only the first few items were accepted.

FILE NOT FOUND  If you were looking for a file on tape, and
END-OF-TAPE marker was found. If you were looking on disk, no file with
that name exists.

FILE NOT OPEN  The file specified in a CLOSE, CMD, PRINT#,
INPUT#, or GET#, must first be OPENed.

FILE OPEN  An attempt was made to open a file using the number of an
already open file.

FORMULA TO COMPLEX  The string expression being evaluated
should be split into at least two parts for the system to work with.

ILLEGAL DIRECT  The INPUT statement can only be used within a
program, and not in direct mode.

ILLEGAL QUANTITY  A number used as the argument of a function or
statement is out of the allowable range.

LOAD  There is a problem with the program on tape.

NEXT WITHOUT FOR  This is caused by either incorrectly nesting loops
or having a variable name in a NEXT statement that doesn't correspond
with one in a FOR statement.

NOT INPUT FILE  An attempt was made to INPUT or GET data from a file
which was specified to be for output only.

OUT OF DATA  A READ statement was executed but there is no data left
unREAD in a DATA statement.

                                    276
~
OUT OF MEMORY  There is no more RAM available for program or
variables. This may also occur when too many FOR loops have been
nested, or when there are too many GOSUBs in effect.

OVERFLOW  The result of a computation is larger than the largest
number allowed, which is 1,70141884E+38

REDIM'D ARRAY  An array may only be DIMensioned once. If an array
variable is used before that array is DIM'd, an automatic DIM operation is
performed on that array setting the number of elements to ten, and any
subsequent DIMs will cause this error.

REDO FROM START  Character data was typed in during an INPUT
statement when numeric data was expected. Just re-type the entry so that
it is correct, and the program will continue by itself.

RETURN WITHOUT GOSUB  A RETURN statement was encountered,
and no GOSUB command has been issued.

STRING TO LONG  A string can contain up to 255 characters.

SYNTAX  A statement is unrecognizable by the VIC. A missing or extra
parenthesis, misspelled keywords, etc.

TYPE MISMATCH  This error occurs when a number is used in place of a
string, or vice-versa.

UNDEF'D FUNCTION  A user defined function was referenced, but it has
never been defined using the DEF FN statement.

UNDEF'D STATEMENT  An attempt was made to GOTO or GOSUB or
RUN a line number that doesn't exist.

VERIFY  The program on tape or disk does not match the program
currently in memory.

                                    277

APPENDIX I

CONVERTING PROGRAMS TO VIC 20
BASIC

  If you have programs written in a BASIC other than VIC 20 BASIC, some
minor adjustments may be necessary before running them with VIC 20
BASIC. The following paragraphs specify things to look for when
converting BASIC programs.

String Dimensions
  Delete all statements that are used to declare the length of strings. A
statement such as DIM A$(I,J), which dimensions a string array for J
elements of length I, should be converted to the VIC 20 BASIC statement
DIM A$(J).
  Some BASICs use a comma or ampersand for string concatenation.
Each of these must be changed to a plus sign, which is the operator for VIC
20 BASIC string concatenation.
  In VIC 20 BASIC, the MID$, RIGHT$, and LEFT$ functions are used to
take substrings of strings. Forms such as A$(I) to access the Ith character
in A$, or A$(I,J) to take a substring of A$ from position I to position J, must
be changed as follows:

  Other BASIC     VIC 20 BASIC
  A$(I)=X$        A$=LEFT$(A$,I-1)+X$+MID$(A$,I+1)
  A$(I,J)=X$      A$=LEFT$(A$,I-1)+X$+MID$(A$,J+1)

Multiple Assignments
  To set B and C equal to zero, some BASICs allow statements of the form:

  10 LET B=C=0

  VIC 20 BASIC would interpret the second equal sign as a logical
operator and set B equal to -1 if C equaled to 0. Instead, convert this
assignment to two assignment statements:

  10 C=0:B=0

Multiple Statements
  Some BASICs use a backslash (\) to separate multiple statements on a
line. With VIC-20 BASIC, be sure all statements on a line are separated by
a colon (:).

Mat Functions
  Programs using the MAT functions available in some BASICs must be
rewritten using FOR...NEXT loops to execute properly.

Character Tokes
  To conserve user space, BASIC keywords are translated to 1-character
tokens. The token values are shown in the following table.

                                    278

ABOUT THE VIC 20
PROGRAMMERS REFERENCE GUIDE...

This easy-to-use manual gives you a ready source of
information on VIC 20 software and hardware, with
detailed explanation of each topic and "friendly"
tips throughout to help you use your VIC 20 to best
advantage.

The VIC PROGRAMMERS REFERENCE GUIDE is
actually four guides in one. It includes (1) a BASIC
VOCABULARY GUIDE which explains the complete
VIC BASIC language instruction set along with (2) a
PROGRAMMING TIPS GUIDE with suggestions on
how to improve your programming, (3) a MACHINE
LANGUAGE PROGRAMMING GUIDE to help you
talk to the VIC in its "own" binary/hexadecimal
language, and (4) a special section on INPUT/
OUTPUT OPERATIONS giving you the information
needed to connect your VIC to special peripherals
like RS232 devices, lightpens and others.

This guide was compiled from information provided
by Commodore programming staffs working in more
than half a dozen countries worldwide.

Whether you're a first-time computerist or an expert
programmer, you'll find a wide variety of program-
ming aids available through your Commodore dealer.
In addition to books and manuals, Commodore
provides several special programming cartridges and
the TEACH YOURSELF PROGRAMMING (tm)
instruction series.
